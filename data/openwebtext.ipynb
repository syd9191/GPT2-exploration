      "Marc NivensIt’s a prominent issue surrounding the electric vehicle market that the old-school lead acid battery just isn’t appropriate for new technology vehicles. Many users of electric vehicles, especially Tesla owners, have cited concerns with the poor performance of their 12V or low-voltage battery, oftentimes requiring annual replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, a lead acid battery in a traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle generally has a 4 year life-cycle, but why?\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, some of the most important factors to consider in longevity of a battery are “cycle-life”, environmental conditions, discharge/charge rates and calendar-life; cycle-life is how many times the battery can be drained and recharged in its life. Environmental conditions include temperature and humidity. Discharge/charge rates are the amperages going out of and into the battery respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two major differences between the way an ICE vehicle uses its 12V battery and the way an EV uses its 12V battery:\n",
      "\n",
      "“OFF” state discharge and cycling frequency\n",
      "\n",
      "ICE Vehicle: generally has a very low 12V load while the vehicle is in the “off” state, often this load doesn’t exceed a few watts and doesn’t present a major challenge for the 12V battery to maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Electric Vehicle: The 12V load while in the off-state is often much higher due to advanced computer systems that are running to maintain the high-voltage battery, keep vehicle “connected” (all EV have some remote access features), maintain charging and BMS (Battery Management System) communications, etc. In fact a Tesla Model S/X puts about 50 Watts of load on the 12V system when the vehicle is in the “off” state. 50 Watts equals about 4.5 Amps of discharge on the 12V battery, this drains the battery down relatively rapidly and requires the 12V battery be “recharged” by the high-voltage battery regularly, this usage pattern results in many cycles being placed on the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“ON” state utilization and purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "ICE Vehicle: The 12V battery is used to initiate the ICE (start the car) and is designed for putting out large amounts of current to accommodate this process. Once an ICE vehicle is in the “on” state, it relies on an alternator to power all of the 12V sub-systems and also maintain the voltage of the 12V battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Electric Vehicle: The 12V is subjected to (practically) no additional load while the vehicle is being turned “on”, and although most vehicles are designed with DC/DC converters (which act as alternators) it is often an engineering design choice to reduce load on the DC/DC converter by minimizing the frequency with which it is utilized. This also extends the driving range of the vehicle because none of the precious high-voltage battery capacity is being shunted to non-driving tasks. Due to this usage profile the 12V battery is subjected to relatively low discharge and recharge currents.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you combine the high number of cycles and the low current requirements of the electric vehicle 12V battery system you arrive at a completely different battery need than that of an ICE vehicle. Lead Acid batteries are very good at high discharge and low cycle count life-styles, this is their bread\n",

However, Israel had demanded that its army be stationed in the West Bank for a further 40 years. According to parliamentary sources, Lammert did not believe that such a long period seemed plausible.

By overseeing a major increase in energy production in the United States, one in which the United States began producing far more oil and gas for use and export, the Obama administration actually contributed to the terrifying trends that are destroying the planet. Obama even bragged about the transformation. In his State of the Union address in 2015, the same one in which he identified climate change as the greatest challenge to the Earth, Obama boasted that “America is number one in oil and gas.”\n",

      "The following year, Energy Department official Melanie Kenderdine provided additional confirmation of the new reality. On the issue of oil production, Kenderdine explained, the United States “is now the number one producer of liquid fuels in the world and within the last two years began producing more oil than it imports for the first time in decades.” Crude oil production in the United States has risen “from an average of 5.1 million barrels per day in 2008 to 9.4 million barrels per day in 2015.”\n",

When he visited McMurdo Station in Antarctica in November 2016 to observe what he called the “dangerous” warming of the area, Kerry insisted that oil-producing countries must continue pumping oil. “Nobody is saying to people, ‘We’re not going to pump, we’re not going to use oil,’” Kerry remarked. The fact is “we’re not going to suddenly wean ourselves off of it.”\n",

      "By making no serious effort to wean the United States off of oil, the Obama administration ensured that the United States remained one of the leading producers of greenhouse gases.

      "Trump’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who ran ExxonMobil before joining the administration, exemplifies the denialist attitude. Asked about climate change during his confirmation hearing, Tillerson said that “I do not see it as the imminent national security threat that perhaps others do.” Tillerson also refused to accept the near certainty that human activity is causing global warming. “The facts on the ground are indisputable in terms of what is happening with drought, disease, insect populations,” Tillerson said. However, “the science behind the clear connection is not conclusive.”\n",

      "Other officials in the Trump administration have displayed the same disregard for the fate of the world. For example, Scott Pruitt at the EPA spent years working on behalf of the energy industry to undermine the Obama administration’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “Energy industry lobbyists drafted letters for him to send to the EPA, the Interior Department, the Office of Management and Budget and even President Obama,” The New York Times disclosed in December 2014.\n",

That's fine for videos you want to upload later, but to live stream, a platform would need to know the exact specifications of each camera and be capable of processing this information into a coherent video for the stream. If it's capable of hammering out industry standards with manufacturers, YouTube could be capable of doing this processing on its end, or — as BuzzFeed News notes — it could simply be speaking with the manufacturers whose cameras are powerful enough to put video from multiple sources together on the fly.\n",

This seems quite likely on Westeros, as anybody going near the slightest puff of dragon breath seems to catch fire, while it’s noticeable that most of the locals are all paranoid about lighting fires anywhere except inside a stone castle.

Argon is 42% more dense than nitrogen and would allow a higher-density atmosphere at a pressure a bit lower than 10 bar.\n",

      "There are two laws relating to gases that can be used here to work out the behaviour of the air mix of argon and oxygen: Charles’ Law to add the components up, and Boyle’s Law to show what happens when the pressure increases. Applying these I can show that at about seven atmosphere’s pressure, a 70% argon, 30% oxygen atmosphere has our air density of 12kg/m3, and so dragons can fly. In simple terms - we can have a more dense atmosphere if the air is heavier - in this case by replacing the inert nitrogen we have on earth with the heavier (or more accurately, denser) argon.\n",

Written across her international travels and recorded between Warsaw and New York, the album trips through spiritual rock music, orchestral pop, primal folk, scuzzy punk, and top notch balladry.

After a brief hiatus, she re-emerged in 2010 with her third album Granda, her most critically revered and commercially successful full-length to date. Granda was an expansive album that merged alt-rock and electronic composition with traditional Polish instrumentation inspired by her father, a travelling musician.

For example the song ‘Haiti’ is about desire, but seen through the eyes of sexual cannibals. The song ‘Horses’ is very metaphorical. It’s about being an outsider rejected by the system and common standards. Horses are the symbol of power, freedom and something pure.

For Clashes, we've been inspired by the liturgical outfits of priests and bishops. So we took the colours and some cuts and we mixed that with Mireille Mathieu and futurism. A few months before I’d finished the album, we started to prepare mood boards and inspirations. We also asked students from the fashion school in Warsaw to design costumes for my new album. I also travel a lot, so I always bring clothes from all around the world. On the cover of Clashes I wear a Samurai outfit that I bought few years ago, already thinking about this album.\n",

My choice is to completely forgo meat and focus instead on dried milk, dried eggs and dried vegetable protein (TVP). Milk, as explained above, you can get cheapest from Walmart online. The eggs and TVP I get from Honeyville (no they are not a sponsor). The food value of a case of 6 #10 cans of dried whole eggs, or TVP, will provide food for a long time, and supplemented with some dried veggies and seasonings, won’t be horrid to eat\n",

In an apneic patient, approximately 250 mL/minute of oxygen will move from the alveoli into the bloodstream. Conversely, only 8 to 20 mL/minute of carbon dioxide moves into the alveoli during apnea, with the remainder being buffered in the bloodstream.53x53Eger, E.I. and Severinghaus, J.W.

      "Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (62) | Google ScholarSee all References The difference in oxygen and carbon dioxide movement across the alveolar membrane is due to the significant differences in gas solubility in the blood, as well as the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. This causes the net pressure in the alveoli to become slightly subatmospheric, generating a mass flow of gas from pharynx to alveoli. This phenomenon, called apneic oxygenation, permits maintenance of oxygenation without spontaneous or administered ventilations. Under optimal circumstances, a PaO 2 can be maintained at greater than 100 mm Hg for up to 100 minutes without a single breath, although the lack of ventilation will eventually cause marked hypercapnia and significant acidosis.54x54Nielsen, N.D., Kjaergaard, B., Koefoed-Nielsen, J. et al.

Were those who each year voted for more taxes than the nation could bear moderates? What about those who never found the contributions to be sufficiently heavy, emoluments sufficiently huge, and sinecures sufficiently numerous … the betrayal of the confidence of their constituents.… And are those who want to prevent the return of such excesses extremists? I mean those who want to inject a dose of moderation into spending; those who want to moderate the action of the people in power … those who do not want the nation to be exploited by one party rather than another.… [T]he government … tends strongly to … expand indefinitely its sphere of action. Left to itself, it soon exceeds the limits which circumscribe its mission. It increases beyond all reason … It no longer administers, it exploits.… It no longer protects, it oppresses. This would be the way all governments operate … if the people did not place obstacles in the way of governmental encroachments. [L]iberty should not be bargained over … it is an asset so precious that no price is too high for it.… [P]rodigality and liberty … are incompatible. But where can there be liberty when the government, in order to sustain enormous expenditures and forced to levy huge fiscal contributions, must resort to the most offensive and burdensome taxation … to invade the sphere of private industry, to narrow incessantly the circle of individual activity, to make itself merchant, manufacturer, postman and teacher.… Are we free if the government … subjects all its activities to the goal of enlarging its cohort of employees, hampers all businesses, constrains all faculties, interferes with all commercial exchanges in order to restrain some people, hinder others, and hold almost all of them to ransom? Can we expect order from a regime that places millions of enticements to greed all around the country … increasingly spreading the mania for governing and a zeal for domination. Do we want then to free government from the plotters who pursue it in order to share out the spoils, from factions who undermine it in order to capture it, and from the tyrants who strengthen it in order to control it? Do we want to achieve order, freedom and public peace? Do we want the government to take more of an interest in us than we take in ourselves? Are we expecting it to restrain itself it we strengthen it and become less active if we send it reinforcements? Do we hope that the spoils it can take from us will be refused.… Should we expect a supernatural nobility of spirit or a chimerical impartiality in those who govern us, while for our part we are incapable of defending … our dearest interests! Electors, be careful. We will not be able to retrieve the opportunity if we let it slip … we should not shut our eyes to the evidence … if there has been no material improvement, have we at least then been given any reason for hope? No. [L]iberty … are we going to destroy its work with our votes?\n",

Despite evidence that a perceived “war on women” lost Republicans women’s votes in the 2012 presidential election, 2013 has seen a huge surge in restrictions on women’s access to safe abortion, as well as demeaning requirements like mandatory ultrasounds such as in the bill Gov.

People hold differing religious and secular views on defining the status of the fetus; in religious terms, there is disagreement on whether there is a “soul” from the time of fertilization. Making abortion illegal means establishing one religious perspective on this vastly complicated issue. In religious or secular spheres, reproductive choices must be a matter of individual conscience.\n",

      " studies and soon-to-be cancelled programs. But the policy also meant there still would be no new ELV rocket engine development. There was neither time nor money available to continue building on the very limited engine foundation started by ALS and NLS. The industry proposals selected by the Air Force for further development for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program reflected these grim realities. McDonnell Douglas chose to develop a largely new booster, using what you might call an extremely “value-engineered” development of the newest US engine available, the SSME, itself dating from the 1970s. Low cost rather than high performance was the major driver, coupled, of course, with schedule limitations. Boeing proposed to use the SSME much as it was employed in the Space Shuttle, drop off the engine in a recoverable module during ascent, and retrieve it from the ocean. Various combinations of existing solid rocket motors employed as strap-on stages would enable the design to handle the requirements of heavier payloads. Alliant Technologies proposed to build an all-solid ELV, based on the new solid strap on motor developed for the Titan IVB. Alliant’s investment in the Titan IVB solid had proved to be disappointing when a combination of serious development problems and the demise of the Soviet Union greatly reduced the numbers of motors needed by the Air Force. Their EELV submission was the company’s attempt to recoup that investment. And finally, Lockheed Martin, already planning to replace the 1950s-vintage MA-5 engines in the Atlas II booster with an engine based on the RD-170 engine that powered Russia’s Zenit booster, proposed to further develop the Atlas line to produce the Atlas V. The Atlas V would use a rigid first stage structure rather than the stainless steel balloon of the earlier Atlas vehicles, combined with the Russian engine, the RD-180. For both Delta IV and Atlas V, the companies planned to employ a modified RL10 engine as the upper stage, 1960s vintage hardware that would still be in use. Both companies also planned to use a storable-fuel upper stage like that used on the Delta II for lower performance missions. The Delta IV storable upper stage would still use the ancient AJ-10 engine as upgraded by the Air Force in the 1970’s. The Atlas V’s Agena 2000 upper stage probably would be quite similar. So there was no new engine development for the upper stage, either. The storable-fuel upper stages eventually were abandoned when the two companies realized it would be cheaper to just build more of the RL10-based upper stages than try to save a few bucks with a cheaper and lower performing engine for a few launches. A SpaceX Falcon 9 lifting off from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX developed its own Merlin engines for the rocket, but those engines are far less powerful that those of interest to the Air Force. (credit: NASA/Charles Babir) But by design, EELV was not the program that would focus on truly new technological developments. While EELV proceeded on its own, per the Moorman Study recommendations NASA would focus on building a new reusable launch vehicle (RLV), featuring new propulsion system designs as required, beginning with a subscale version, the X-33. And in reality the engines proposed for the new RLV were not all that new. Rockwell/Northrop and McDonnell Douglas/Boeing both proposed to use the SSME in their X-33 designs. Lockheed Martin planned to base their engine design on the 1960s-vintage J-2 engine used in the Saturn program. Eventually this effort resulted in the Lockheed Martin VentureStar RLV design—which was cancelled years later when studies showed it would not work, or at least not work well enough to meet NASA’s extremely challenging requirements (those largely derived from the shuttle program). Thus, new rocket engine development, never a real priority for the X-33 program, fell by the wayside yet again. EELV was left as the only viable new launch vehicle program. Even before EELV began, a key question was how many solid rocket motors or liquid engines will be required to achieve the thrust level needed. In studies done in the early 1990s, the answer that came back for liquid-engined vehicles was that either one or two engines would be required, but no more than that. The Falcon 1’s Merlin engine was the lowest thrust first stage engine used by a US space booster since the puny propulsion system employed by Vanguard in the 1950’s. Building two smaller engines offers the potential for lower development costs but is offset by the requirement that you have to build more engines for each vehicle, driving up production costs. Designs based on one engine may cost more to develop but should have lower costs once the program gets going. It’s a classic trade-off situation. Multiple engines generally do not offer the ability to survive an in-flight engine failure; there’s not usually enough design margin left\n",

With Windows 10, your app can check at runtime, whether a class, method, property, event or API contract is supported by the current operating system. If so, the app can then call the appropriate API. The ApiInformation class located in the Windows.Foundation.Metadata namespace contains several static methods (like IsApiContractPresent, IsEventPresent, and IsMethodPresent) which are used to query for APIs. Here’s an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "using Windows.Foundation.Metadata; if(ApiInformation.IsTypePresent(\"Windows.Media.Playlists.Playlist\")) { await myAwesomePlaylist.SaveAsAsync( ... ); }\n",
      "\n",
      "This code\n",
      "\n",
      "makes a runtime check for the presence of the Playlist class, then\n",
      "\n",
      "statically references and calls the SaveAsAsync method on the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note the ease of checking for the presence of a type on the current operating system using the IsTypePresent API. Formerly, such a check might have required LoadLibrary, GetProcAddress, QueryInterface, Reflection, use of the ‘dynamic’ keyword, and others, depending on language and framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also note the static reference when making the method call. When using Reflection and/or ‘dynamic’, you lose static compile-time diagnostics that would, for example, inform you if you misspelled the method name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detecting with API contracts\n",
      "\n",
      "So what’s an API contract? At heart, an API contract is a set of APIs. A hypothetical API contract could represent a set of APIs containing two classes, five interfaces, one structure, two enums and so on. We group logically related types into an API contract. In many ways, an API contract represents a feature – a set of related APIs that together deliver some particular functionality. Every Windows Runtime API from Windows 10 onward is a member of some API contract. The documentation at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn706135.aspx describes the variety of API contracts available. You’ll see that most of them represent a set of functionally related APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the grouping into an API contract also provides you, the developer, some additional guarantees. The most important one is that when a platform implements *any* API in an API contract, we require that platform to implement *every* API in that API contract. In other words, an API contract is an atomic unit, and testing for support of that API contract is equivalent to testing that each and every API in the set is supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does this mean for your app?\n",
      "\n",
      "It allows your app to test whether the running OS supports a particular API contract and, after determining it does, call any of the APIs in that API contract without checking each one individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest and most commonly used API contract is the Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract. It contains nearly all of the APIs in the Universal Windows Platform. If you wanted to see if the current OS supports the\n",

      "\"There is no denying that Canada continues to have a significant copyright infringement problem,\" Malcolmson said. \"Many of the most prominent global players in the piracy ecosystem operate out of Canada as a relative safe harbour, and Canadians made 1.88 billion visits to piracy sites last year.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, again. Just like with salary cap information and contract details, fans are once again being forced to play guessing games. This week, it was over the latest trend in deadline trades: conditional picks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In theory, conditional picks are exactly what they sound like. Two teams agree to include a draft pick in a trade, and then come up with one or more conditions to determine what kind of pick it will be. And then, this being the NHL, they don't tell anyone what those conditions are.\n",
      "\n",
      "We eventually find out anyways, often within minutes of the trade coming out. Most times it's something simple—if Team A makes the conference final, Team B's pick is one round better. Other times, like with Kevin Shattenkirk, it gets a lot more complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "GMs should feel free to make as many of these kind of trades as they can; anything that gets the trade market moving is OK by us. But the NHL needs to tell us what the conditions are. It's kind of important.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one example, look at the deal between the Canucks and Sharks. San Jose got veteran Jannik Hansen, while Vancouver got a young player and a conditional fourth. That sounds fine. But later we found out that if the Sharks win the Cup this year, the pick becomes a first-rounder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, hold on. That's kind of a big thing to know. When you hear \"conditional fourth,\" you don't typically think about a pick that could jump all the way to the first round. Even if the odds are relatively slim, the possibility can change your whole view of the trade. And I bet that some Sharks and Canucks fans didn't even realize that was the condition until just now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like with most of these situations, the NHL could easily fix this problem with one memo telling teams to just put all the information in the press release. But it won't.

Initially, it was difficult for us, but, as I grew older, I kept learning more about healthy eating habits. After I stopped eating meat, I noticed a positive effect in my body. Later, I stopped drinking regular milk, substituting it with vegan alternatives. I don’t understand why we need to kill animals, if everything that our body needs can be found in plants?

And the sailors in question have no choice but to hire civilian lawyers to defend them because sexual orientation isn’t included in the Pentagon’s non-discrimination policies, and won’t be even if DADT is fully repealed this year. This is why the President has to sign an executive order adding the military to federal government’s already-existing policies outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Washington Post does a good job of telling the tale, but in a nutshell, the Navy has suddenly decided that sailors aren’t permitted to fall asleep in a same-sex friend’s bed, even platonically, and especially while watching “The Vampire Diaries” – it was unclear whether the Navy felt vampires were gay, or diaries were gay, or whether it’s just the entire CW network that’s too queer for the Pentagon.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the Navy is charging the men with: “willful failure to exhibit professional conduct.” Because one fell asleep in the other guy’s room. (One guy copped a plea and got his pay docked, but he gets to stay in as a results – the other is being discharged because he wouldn’t admit to the charges.)\n",

      "I’ve asked around and apparently there’s no way these guys would have gotten into trouble had someone found a girl asleep in some guy’s bed, but a guy – look out. And that is a prima facie a case of sexual orientation discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Navy pretty much admits that this is an anti-gay witch hunt. Check this out from the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dougan, the Navy spokesman, acknowledged that no regulation specifically prohibits sailors from falling asleep in the same bed. He said rules do require them to “behave professionally in the barracks” and that Capt. Thomas W. Bailey, the commanding officer, concluded that Jones and McGee had not done so. “The determination was that two sailors sharing the same rack was unprofessional.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a minute. Two sailors sharing the same rack is unprofessional. Hear that. There’s now a new policy in the Navy that sailors are never permitted to share a bed with another sailor.\n",

      "There’s no regulation against falling asleep in the same bed, but the Navy wants to kick a sailor out for this egregious “crime” which isn’t even on the books, and which wouldn’t be a crime if the other body had been female. But it’s not an anti-gay witch hunt, really it’s not.\n",
      "\n",
      "We already have an executive order on the books that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal government, but it exempts the military (because DADT was still on the books when the executive order was issued). Once DADT is gone later this year, the President needs to immediately issue an updated executive order that includes the Pentagon as well. If he doesn’t, then I fear the battle over DADT won’t be going away any time soon, especially before the 2012 elections.\n",

      " to be accessed without going through the page cache. The XIP code has apparently seen little use, though, and has not been improved in some years; it does not work with current filesystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, Matthew Wilcox began work on improving the XIP code and integrating it into the ext4 filesystem. Along the way, he found that it was not well suited to the needs of contemporary filesystems; there are a number of unpleasant race conditions in the code as well. So over time, his work shifted from enhancing XIP to replacing it. That work, currently a 21-part patch set, is getting closer to being ready for merging into the mainline, so it is beginning to get a bit more attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those patches replace the XIP code with a new subsystem called DAX (for \"direct access,\" apparently). At the block device level, it replaces the existing direct_access() function in struct block_device_operations with one that looks like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "long (*direct_access)(struct block_device *dev, sector_t sector, void **addr, unsigned long *pfn, long size);\n",
      "\n",
      "This function accepts a sector number and a size value saying how many bytes the caller wishes to access. If the given space is directly addressable, the base (kernel) address should be returned in addr and the appropriate page frame number goes into pfn . The page frame number is meant to be used in page tables when arranging direct user-space access to the memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of page frame numbers and addresses may seem a bit strange; most of the kernel deals with memory at this level via struct page . That cannot be done here, though, for one simple reason: non-volatile memory is not ordinary RAM and has no page structures associated with it. Those missing page structures have a number of consequences; perhaps most significant is the fact that NVM cannot be passed to other devices for DMA operations. That rules out, for example, zero-copy network I/O to or from a file stored on an NVM device. Boaz Harrosh is working on a patch set allowing page structures to be used with NVM, but that work is in a relatively early state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving up the stack, quite a bit of effort has gone into pushing NVM support into the virtual filesystem layer so that it can be used by all filesystems. Various generic helpers have been set up for common operations (reading, writing, truncating, memory-mapping, etc.). For the most part, the filesystem need only mark DAX-capable inodes with the new S_DAX flag and call the helper functions in the right places; see the documentation in the patch set for (a little) more information. The patch set finishes by adding the requisite support to ext4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Morton expressed some skepticism about this work, though. At the top of his list of questions was: why not use a \"suitably modified\" version of an in-memory filesystem (ramfs or tmpfs, for example) instead? It seems like a reasonable question; those filesystems are already designed for directly-addressable memory and have the necessary optimizations. But RAM-based filesystems are designed for RAM; it turns out that they are not all that well suited to the NVM case.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the details of why that is, this message from Dave Chinner is well worth reading in its entirety. To a great extent, it comes down to this: the RAM-based filesystems have not been designed to deal with persistence. They start fresh at each boot and need never cope with something left over from a previous run of the system. Data stored in NVM, instead, is expected to persist over reboots, be robust in the face of crashes, not go away when the kernel is upgraded, etc. That adds a whole set of requirements that RAM-based filesystems do not have to satisfy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for example, NVM filesystems need all the tools that traditional filesystems have to recognize filesystems on disk, check them, deal with corruption, etc. They need all of the techniques used by filesystems to ensure that the filesystem image in persistent storage is in a consistent state at all times; metadata operations must be carefully ordered and protected with barriers, for example. Since compatibility with different kernels is important, no in-kernel data structures can be directly stored in the filesystem; they must be translated to and from an on-disk format. Ordinary filesystems do these things; RAM-based filesystems do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as Dave explained, there is the little issue of scalability:\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, it's going to need to scale to very large amounts of storage. We're talking about machines with *tens of TB* of NVDIMM capacity in the immediate future and so free space management and concurrency of allocation and freeing of used space is going to be fundamental to the performance of the persistent\n",

      "In order to be considered healthy, open source communities must have the capacity to outlive their founder’s original interest in them If they rely heavily on a dictator, they risk fragmenting and falling apart when their leaders move on or retire.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most communities, even those governed by dictatorships, people other than the founder will increasingly become responsible for making key decisions. The natural outcome of this is a move towards consensus-based democracy. This new arrangement does not imply that all decisions, however minor, are made by committee. Most of the time proposals are decided on the basis of ‘lazy consensus’ where ‘silence gives assent’. To deal with proposals that don’t reach consensus most communities institue some form of voting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more complicated these habits and procedures become, the more important it becomes to aid newcomers with instructions on how they can begin to take part and have a say in the decision making process. Young communities might fall back on the body of knowledge built up and captured in mailing list threads but this does not always help newcomers and can leave them confused. What is needed is something written down, a ‘governance model’, to capture this shared understanding in a concise documentary form. Formalising arrangements helps ensure the community has a life of its own - independent of any one individual - that can survive and flourish for as long as there is a genuine sustained need for the project’s outputs.\n",

      "Building a community around a piece of open source software can be slow, hard work and success is contingent on many things. Nevertheless, without a community, there simply is no project. Community building does not happen automatically and has to be carefully managed. All communities start with users, attracted by the software’s packaging and branding, or word-of-mouth recommendations. Once they arrive, however, the challenge then is living up to these high expectations. A thriving developer community can meet and exceed these expectations, but only if their leader can keep it together and ensure participants do not go off on their own. In the long run, communities need to have open development mechanisms in place to ensure that when key contributors, including the founders, move on, their roles are adopted by others.\n",

The boot loader's development has been sponsored by the Linux Foundation. The revised version uses a different method to boot the more complex secondary bootloader; this enables it to co-operate with Gummiboot, which was introduced last summer. Gummiboot doesn't load or start Linux itself like GRUB does, instead it accesses EFI mechanisms; this keeps its structure significantly less complex than that of GRUB. When Secure Boot is active, however, this approach requires other, firmware-related mechanisms to verify the kernel before it is launched.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a blog post, Bottomley says that, as a consequence of this, Gummiboot doesn't work with Shim or the original version of the Linux Foundation's bootloader when Secure Boot is active. Further details can be found in the slides for a presentation� given by Bottomley, a member of the Linux Foundation's Technical Advisory Board, at Linux.conf.au 2013. In this presentation, he explains that the kernel and Gummiboot versions should not be verified via keys, and that user-authorised hash values should be used instead. To provide this functionality, the new version uses some trickery that is also part of an extension which was introduced by SUSE developers and has since been integrated into Shim 0.2; this extension allows Shim to store trusted code information in a \"MOKs\" (Machine Owner Keys) database.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Bottomley's presentation slides, it takes a week or two for Microsoft to respond to bootloader submissions and provide a signature that is considered trustworthy by Secure Boot PCs. This means that the difficulties Bottomley encountered when he tried to get an earlier version of his mini bootloader signed last autumn appear to have been eliminated. Bottomley says that he submitted the revised version to be signed by Microsoft on 21 January, and that he hopes to receive a signed version shortly. The Linux Foundation plans to offer this signed version for download free of charge.\n",

In this post, the developer provides some details about the problems that have caused Samsung notebooks to refuse to start at all after Linux was booted.

At the same time he and the C9 – his advisory body of cardinals - have been looking at the role of papal nuncios, and how to better support and define the role. The creation of the new section also comes three months after the Vatican recalled a diplomat from Washington for suspected child-porn violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "A letter sent by the Pope on 19 October to Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Secretary of State, Francis explains he is setting up the new body: “in the conviction that I must assure more fraternal attention and prompter human, priestly, spiritual and professional accompaniment to those who serve in the so-called ‘diplomatic role’ of the Holy See - heads of mission and collaborators – and to those who are preparing for it – students of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vatican diplomats are selected from among talented priests who have spent time studying in Rome and are then sent to the prestigious “Accademia” for a period of intensive training during which they are expected to become proficient in numerous languages. Afterwards they are sent abroad on various postings or are asked to work at the Secretariat of State before eventually being ordained as archbishops in order to serve as papal nuncios. While they represent the Pope in any given country they are also tasked with helping draw up shortlists for the appointment of bishops. The role can be varied and exciting but is also demanding and at times lonely with diplomats expected to serve for long periods in cultures very different from their own. It appears that Francis has identified a need to better support them both pastorally and professionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Holy See has diplomatic relations with 183 states and nuncios and their staff must be prepared to serve in danger zones such as Syria and war torn parts of Africa. Papal embassies have a policy of staying in a country regardless of the security situation. In Damascus, Cardinal Mario Zenari is one of the few western diplomats left in the country, while during the 2003 Iraq War and its aftermath the then papal ambassador, Cardinal Fernando Filoni, stayed in Baghdad as bombs fell next to his home. 14 years ago in Burundi, the papal nuncio, Irish Archbishop Michael Courtney, was shot dead in an ambush while driving in the south of the country - he had been attempting to mediate between the government and rebels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Archbishop Courtney was succeeded by British Archbishop Paul Gallagher, now the Vatican’s foreign minister equivalent, whose residence in the country was bombed in 2008. While there are plenty of stories of heroism among Holy See diplomats there have also been scandals. Along with the recalling of a papal diplomat in Washington there was the case of Archbishop Józef Wesolowski, who died in 2015 while awaiting trial for sex abuse offences.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the whole, Vatican diplomats conduct their work behind the scenes and out of the limelight. Over the years papal diplomats have played key mediatory roles in Latin American countries and during his papacy, Francis has been credited with helping normalise relations between Cuba and the United States while also helping encourage a peace process in Colombia. This Pope works closely with the Secretariat of State and it has become the Vatican dicastery upon which he relies on most closely. Benedict XVI, who for years ran the other important curial office – the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith – at times showed less interest in Church diplomacy and ruffled feathers by appointing a non-diplomat, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as his Secretary of State. While there are cases where prelates have been appointed as papal ambassadors despite not being trained as diplomats, it is a relatively rare occurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new diplomatic section – which up until now has been the office of the delegate for the pontifical Representations – will co-ordinate with the two other sections inside the Secretariat of State. The first is that of General Affairs, which is led by Archbishop Giovanni Becciu, the ‘sostituto’ who is the equivalent of a deputy Prime Minister and has a crucial co-ordinating role inside the Roman Curia. In his letter Francis points out he will continue to deal with some “general issues” of papal diplomatic postings.

      "The events these last few days in Ferguson, Missouri ought to be of grave concern to anyone who believes in the First Amendment, and specifically the rights to free speech, protest, and assembly. As you may have read, last night was particularly ugly, as police arrested a St. Louis alderman, Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly, and our own Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery. Police also tear-gassed a news crew from Al-Jazeera. There are also reports, video, and images of police teargassing, arresting, and otherwise intimidating peaceful protests all over the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it’s true that there have been incidents of rioting, looting, and violence directed at police, the initial protests against Michael Brown’s killing were peaceful.* The only hint of violence at the first protest was described by an Associated Press reporter, who reported chants of “kill the police.” That report has since been disputed by people at the protest, who have suggested that the AP journalist or police misheard other chants. From what I can find, that report was also never confirmed by any other journalist. The problem lies in how local police responded to that initial protest. They brought out the full riot arsenal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we have a community that doesn’t see itself reflected in the police force. Ferguson is 67 percent black, while its police force is more than 90 percent white. It’s a community with long-simmering racial tension between police and the people they serve. It has now been well-reported that blacks are significantly over-represented when it comes to stop-and-frisks, traffic stops, and arrests in Ferguson, even though the town’s white residents are more likely to be caught with contraband like drugs or illegal weapons. It isn’t difficult to see why black residents of Ferguson may have already felt as if the police are an outside force that has been imposed upon them, rather than a group of public servants selected from the community to protect them from harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then have an incident that represents all of these problems in a very concentrated form — an unarmed black man was killed by a (reportedly) white police officer who had stopped him as he was walking home. The police have since refused to release the officer’s name. They’ve said they have no intention of releasing the autopsy performed on Michael Brown. Police Chief Thomas Jackson refused to even say how many shots were fired at Brown. (He claimed he didn’t know, though that would be pretty easy to figure out.) Though the police department has body cameras, it hasn’t required its officers to actually wear them. All of this only adds to perception of a Ferguson Police Department that is detached, unaccountable, opaque, and unconcerned with how it is perceived by the community it serves. (Gassing, arresting, and threatening journalists doesn’t help with the perception that they feel they’re above transparency.) The police then showed up at a peaceful protest with military vehicles and weapons. If a town’s citizens are reminded over and over again that the law has no respect for them, we shouldn’t be surprised if they begin to lose respect for the law. This isn’t an excuse for the looting and rioting. But it does contextualize what we’ve seen.\n",

      "One of the pioneers of community policing — a form of policing that stresses interaction over reaction, deescalation over brute force, and that police should have a stake in the communities they serve —is Jerry Wilson, who was appointed police chief for Washington, D.C. in 1969. Wilson was of course appointed during a very turbulent time in America, and he took office just after the riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. had ripped the city apart. But Wilson went to great pains to recruit police officers from the city’s residents, and to try to make the police force more reflective of the city. He also took a much different approach to protest. I interviewed Wilson for my recent book on police militarization. Here’s a passage from the section about Wilson’s approach to protest:\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson believed that an intimidating police presence didn’t prevent confrontation, it invited it. That didn’t mean he didn’t prepare, but he put his riot control teams in buses, then parked the buses close by, but out of sight of protesters. Appearances were important. In general, instead of the usual brute force and reactionary policing that tended to pit cops against citizens—both criminal and otherwise—Wilson believed that cops were more effective when they were welcomed and respected in the neighborhoods they patrolled. “The use of violence\n",

They would run on other IRT lines until 1984 when they were supplanted by the R-62 line. In later years, they could be coupled with cars from other series. This R-15 car, Number 6239, is the only one remaining. Note the red cushion seats.

      "The R-1 was the first car used on the new 8th Avenue IND subway in 1932. The most innovative feature of the new cars was the four sets of double doors on each side, which permitted faster loading and unloading of passengers. The cars were 60 feet long and had 60 seats. In those days manufacturers were still building seats in subway cars in both crosswise and facing patterns. The cars were painted a somber dark green, though wicker seats and white porcelain handholds livened things up. It was during this era that Duke Ellington’s swing classic “Take the A Train” was written.\n",

They also saw service on other IRT lines, including the former Bowling Green Shuttle, until their retirement in 1981. R-12s were among the last new cars that had wicker seating installed.

Before their retirement in 1965 they served on all Southern Division BMT lines, or trains going to Bay Ridge or Coney Island. D-Type Triplexes were the first train cars to carry roll signs with route designations on the lead car. On the BMT, the lines were originally numbered from #1 to #16.

Developed to be used in new subway routes built under the Dual Contracts subway funding project of 1911, the BRT developed its Standard car in 1916, using Boston Elevated cars as its model. These cars were the first to be made of steel instead of wood. The cars contained 78 seats, many more than the main competitor at the time, the IRT, which could seat 44 people per car. Altogether, with standees, each car could hold up to 180 people. These were also the first cars that could be entered via pneumatically-controlled doors in the center of the car. By 1921, a conductor could open all doors in every car at the same time, also a first.\n",

      "\n",
      "A: Sure. For starters, this is the first co-op map to feature a gathering-style mechanic, where your workers are collecting something in the world quickly and bringing it back to your base. The second new aspect is the lava, which makes you think on your feet and manage your units as the lava level changes.\n",

      "Q: What considerations did you make in adapting the original map to co-op missions?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: For the original map, the focus was on gathering a specific amount of resources before the AI. Since it was a Terran map, there were lots of minerals on the low ground, and you could take your Command Center airborne in order to move your base around when the lava was active.\n",
      "\n",
      "The protoss and zerg don't work as well with that mechanic, so we adapted the map to have a greater mix of high and low ground, rather than mostly low ground.

We just removed the element of gameplay where you're actually spending time mining resources.\n",

      "Q: So it has a gathering mechanic, but you’re not spending time mining resources?\n",

      "A: Right. For this map, your workers will collect xenon crystals while your other units protect them. Unlike minerals, xenon crystals can be mined immediately, without having to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with the change to xenon crystals, the new goal for this map is to gather 20 crystals before the planet explodes.

      "If I have a short task (ideally – no more than 30-45 minutes) that I want some help with, I just find someone on my team and ask for some help. Hopefully, you’re not in a team where asking for help sounds problematic. Then, once you’re both on your computer and working on the problem – you’re pairing. That was easy, wasn’t it?

I just love seeing how after a few weeks, people come and ask for help if you’re not around, and how slowly the idea of doing some tasks together becomes obvious. I don’t have to have them call it pairing, and it doesn’t have to be 100% of the time. The bottom line is that good practices stick, even unconsciously.\n",

After initial hesitation on Scott's part, Meyers managed to persuade him with help from The After Jam producer Jason Gallagher, who happened to be Scott's brother-in-law. The other actors soon followed suit, with Gallagher helping them learn how to play the instruments.

      "Analysis First of all, let’s see how pocket was used by me. To this end, the number of articles are plotted, based on when they were added: I started using Pocket in 2012 in a rather limited way, stopping at the end of 2012 at 24 stored articles. This stop continued until mid of 2014. At first, just a brief usage is visible. Then, the usage skyrocketed, resulting in a total number of 308 articles. One possible explanation could be that the mode of usage changed significantly comparing to the first usage in 2012, since the number of added articles per month appears to be much larger: After stopping to use Pocket at the end of 2012, I gave it a shot again in April 2014. However, the real start appears to be in May. In fact, after starting to use pocket again, the usage in the second to fifth month (May 2014 to August 2014) is very high, followed by a reduced usage in the next four month (September 2014 to December 2014). In order to check, if the mode of usage changed, the most visited domains in 2012 and 2014 are compared: There are only four domains in 2012 that contributed more than one article to my Pocket archive. The top domain is Lifehacker, which incidentally lead me to use Pocket in the first place. Second place goes to YouTube, followed by ted.com as another video-resource and Süddeutsche, a German newspaper. In 2014 the variety of domains has changed, allowing a display of top 10 domains with more than one article contribution. The top contributor is now Wired. Lifehacker and YouTube are still strong, followed by recode.net and Spiegel Online, a German magazine. In order to discover whether the top domains constantly contribute to the archive or whether there are certain months with a lot of consumption of a particular domain, the number of articles per month are plotted: Most of the wired.com articles were added in May to August, afterwards the number declines. Lifehacker articles are strong in May but decline afterwards rather quickly. YouTube appears to be somehow constant, since it does not display a decline but more of an on/off pattern. Let’s see how much the identified top domains contribute to the total number of articles per month: After July, a notable decline in share can be noted, even though the share recovers in the following months until December, where the lowest share so far is achieved.

The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong.[14] Later accounts have both sides believing themselves to be drastically outnumbered by the enemy; the Yuanshi provides an estimate of 102,000 for the Japanese force, while the Japanese Hachiman Gudokun describes the invaders as outnumbering the Japanese 10 to 1.[15] Conlan argues that the Yuanshi's account of the battle suggests that both the Japanese and Yuan forces were of similar size.

      "The Japanese were inexperienced in managing such a large force (all of North Kyūshū had been mobilized), and the Mongols made significant initial progress. It had been approximately 50 years since the last major combat event in Japan (Go-Toba's adherents in 1221), leaving not a single Japanese general with adequate experience in moving large bodies of troops. In addition, the style of warfare that was customary within feudal Japan involved single combat, even on large battlefields.\n",

      "The Mongols possessed foreign weapons which included superior long-range armaments (the short composite bows that the Mongols were famous for, with poisoned arrows, fire arrows, bow-launched arrows with small rocket engines attached and gunpowder-packed exploding arrows and grenades with ceramic shells thrown by slings to terrify the enemy's horses), and easily had the upper hand in open land combat. The Japanese force at Hakata Bay needed time to await the arrival of reinforcements, with which they would be able to overwhelm the Mongol invaders.\n",

      "Around nightfall, the Mongol ship captains suggested that the land force reembark in order to avoid the risk of being marooned on Japanese soil. Hong Dagu, the commander of the exhausted Mongolian army, further decided in a military meeting for withdrawal from Japan. For the ships at that time the navigation to north, i.e. from Hakata to Korea's south-eastern shores, was risky, if not in daytime and under south wind. However, they pressed ahead the retreating action in night and met a stormy wind. Some accounts offer casualty reports that suggest 200 Mongol ships were lost. However, small Japanese boats were much more swift and maneuverable than Mongol ships, and the Japanese were able to board the remaining ships of the crippled Mongol army. The samurai approached and boarded the ships under cover of darkness and fell on the invaders ferociously. In the small confines of the ships, during the predawn darkness, the Mongols (trained as cavalrymen and horse archers) were unable to bring their bows to bear effectively. However, the long, thin Japanese swords got stuck and snapped off in the thick, boiled leather armor of the Mongols, causing Japanese blacksmiths to reevaluate their swords after the first invasion. This led to the beginning of the divergence of the katana from existing tachi swords in the 13th and 14th century.[17]\n",

Tokimune went to Bukko and said, \"Finally there is the greatest happening of my life.\" Bukko asked, \"How do you plan to face it?\" Tokimune screamed, \"Katsu!\" (\"Victory!\") as if he wanted to scare all the enemies in front of him. Bukko responded with satisfaction, \"It is true that the son of a lion roars as a lion!\"[18] Since that time, Tokimune was instrumental in spreading Zen and Bushido in Japan among the samurai.\n",

These contracts make the case of Papua very different from that of Timor-Leste, which was able to split from Indonesia in 2002 after a long and sometimes brutal occupation. Papua is so heavily endowed with mineral wealth that Indonesia seems unlikely ever to loosen its grip. For decades now, the government has encouraged migrants from Java and other densely populated islands to find a new home in Papua. The consequences of this policy can be seen easily in Jayapura. It has become a predominantly Indonesian port city. The Papuans here have been made a minority in their own land.\n",
      "\n",
      "I meet my first Papuan contact in an open-air restaurant near the harbour, far from the house where I stay. She turns out to be a shy woman who speaks good English, a student and a member of the radical National Committee of West Papua (KNPB), which has close links with guerrillas in the jungle. She refuses to have a meal in an Indonesian restaurant. We drink juice in a café and make plans to drive to a safe house outside Jayapura.\n",
      "\n",
      "The safe house turns out to be only a short drive away, in a valley not far from an army garrison. Our car brings us to a house surrounded by shacks with corrugated iron roofs, all inhabited by Papuans. Before I am allowed to alight, several young Papuans scout the area, to see that nobody is watching us. We remove our shoes outside the entrance. A stream of visitors pours into the house after us, and the pile of shoes outside gets bigger and bigger. Reckoning that it could attract unwelcome attention, a young man brings the shoes inside. Curtains are drawn to shield us from curious passers-by. But for the people inside, the room is almost empty. We sit on the floor, eight men and two women. The student translates into English as everyone is introduced. A man across the circle catches my eye immediately; he does not look like a Papuan at all. He has a Portuguese name and hails from Timor-Leste. He explains that he came to Papua almost two years ago to support the KNPB, but he demurs saying whether he is on an official mission or not. “This place is not very safe,” he offers.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is not the only foreign national in the circle. There is a pastor from the neighbouring state of Papua New Guinea—the island's eastern half—who identifies himself as a member of the guerrilla movement. He says the KNPB “and the fighters in the forests are working together very closely.” Moses Tabuni, a spokesman for the KNPB, explains that the guerrillas of the Free Papua Movement (OPM)—“the fighters in the forests”—have been fighting the Indonesians since the 1960s. The pastor from Papua New Guinea speaks of joining the two groups to form a Revolutionary Army of West Papua. “We have lost so many people that we want to organise our struggle in a new network.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Tabuni wears a wristband emblazoned with the morning star. Its image became the official ensign of West Papua during a ten-month period from 1961 to 1962, when the region gained its independence from the Netherlands. That was when the island's western half changed its name from Dutch New Guinea to West Papua—to distinguish it from Papua New Guinea to the east. After its short-lived independence West Papua was temporarily administered by the UN and then annexed by Indonesia in 1969. (Indonesia has designated its share of New Guinea with several names since then, but it has never allowed the whole region to be called “West Papua”.)\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the KNPB's young members says that they are only interested in organising demonstrations against the occupation. As such, all they want is the free exercise of their democratic rights, such as Indonesians elsewhere have been enjoying since 1998. “But the Indonesians call us troublemakers and terrorists. Should we not be allowed to gather and demonstrate in a democracy? It seems that democracy is all right for the Indonesians but not for us Papuans.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the American mining giant Freeport-McMoRan wants to continue to extract our copper and gold, and if BP wants our natural gas, then they have to support our struggle,” says Mr Tabuni.

      "Tottenham's departure from the continental is most obvious during shooting drills. Rather than a quick interchange of passes before a shot, the two strikers have to compete for the ball and shoot as soon as they have anything approximating a clear sight on goal -- while the other tries to stop them by any means necessary. There's no time to pick out a perfect shot, which translates to hitting the ball in the direction of the goal as hard as possible as soon as you find yourself with a fraction of a yard.\n",

      "Imagining the same setup with actual footballers, it's easy to see how it would simulate (and stimulate) the madcap action that occurs in the 'red zone' of both penalty areas, from which the vast majority of the goals are scored.

      "\n",
      "Then The Stoke Game started. It's a fairly simple idea; an extension of the messy shooting drill we'd been practicing for the previous 10 minutes. Two teams of six play in a tight space, with the ball lobbed in at random. Both sides are trying to control the ball and shoot as quickly as possible, and with no room to be found it's almost impossible to construct anything approximating coherent football.\n",

      "Head tennis followed by flailing about was generally the order of the day. Naturally, the lack of shin pads came back to haunt me. I had committed a cardinal sin of The Stoke Game -- attempting to run with the ball. I skipped past one challenge, and was in the process of successfully navigating the second when my punishment arrived in the form of a studs-up, Shawcrossian tackle to my standing leg. It got nowhere near the ball, of course, but the general sentiment was that I deserved it for having the temerity to try to dribble, and The Stoke Game doesn't have fouls anyway. Truly, this is preparation for the Premier League.\n",

      "Minor injuries aside, it was easy to see the intent. By forcing every player to fight and battle for possession (and there were a few stray elbows to go along with the crunching tackles), Tottenham instill their youngsters with a healthy appetite for physical play to go along with the technical and tactical attributes they teach elsewhere. It's not traditional English football, and it's not the Spanish model. The intent seems to be to take the best aspects of both.\n",

      "\n",
      "While the stated goal of the Academy is to get players into the first team, most of the youngsters won't make it that far. For me, though, the real purpose of youth development is to maximise the potential of everyone who comes through the system. Spurs players are being taught a modern footballing curriculum, and they're being taught well. The vast majority of them will, if they want to, have long careers at a high level even if they don't make the grade with Spurs -- and there'll be plenty who do make it.\n",

      "\n",
      "DD Fist of the North Star 2 is a fairly niche anime and that’s not just talking about its reliance on slapstick. While reading this review, you may have found a few instances where you wish you knew more about certain characters and the differences in their roles from the original work to this parody. If this applies to you, a lot of this series will go over your head. For example, though they make up reasons for things like only one brother being able to enter the school, a few concepts in the anime have deeper meaning in regards to parody. As I just stated, Ryuken must choose one of the brothers to enroll in the school, and all along the way he tests them and makes them compete for the privilege. This is actually based on the original anime, where he had to choose one of the brothers to become the true heir to the Divine Fist of the North Star. In a similar fashion, a decent amount of character interaction loses its meaning if you don’t have a basic knowledge of pretty much all the heroes and villains of the original Fist of the North Star. However, unlike the first season, enough of the characters have newly manufactured character traits that they’re entertaining without the knowledge as well.\n",

      "The plot of Hard To Be A God—the late Aleksei German’s decades-in-the-making medieval sci-fi flick—is relatively straightforward, but it’s often difficult to follow, because it’s buried under all of the mud, muck, smoke, decay, and shit that German crams into every frame. To put it another way: If Hard To Be A God isn’t the filthiest, most fetid-looking movie ever made, it’s certainly in the top three. Everyone seems to be continually kicking each other, spitting on each other, or beating each other—and if they’re not, it’s because they’re busy picking things out of the mud, poking bare and dirty asses with spears, or smelling what they just wiped off their boots. It is grotesque and deranged and Hieronymus Bosch-like, and damn if it isn’t a bona fide vision—but of what, exactly?\n",

It’s an adaptation of a 1964 novel by the Strugatsky brothers, Arkady and Boris, heavyweights of Soviet sci-fi. The Strugatskys wrote Roadside Picnic, which Andrei Tarkovsky adapted as Stalker, and Definitely Maybe, which Aleksandr Sokurov made into Days Of Eclipse.

This is good for a couple of reasons – firstly is availability. If we were to lose a host, and an NSX Edge, the route will time out quicker than NSX Edge High Availability – thus providing higher availability for our network traffic. Then second reason is throughput – each NSX Edge is capable of ~10Gbps throughput, but with ECMP we can have multiple NSX Edges (up to 8) providing 10Gbps each – that’s a significant performance boost.\n",

As I want to provide multiple routes in and out for scalability and resilience, I’ve got two NSX Edges deployed. For ECMP you need to configure a different VLAN for each PLR to connect to the upstream router, so one has an uplink interface to VLAN1, the other to VLAN100. Both have an internal interface to VXLAN5001, which is a Logical Switch supporting my Provider Transit Network.\n",

      "bas, in 570 at bats, Keeler struck out only twice, setting an AB-per-K mark of 285, an MLB single-season record.[4] With Ned Hanlon's Baltimore Orioles, he perfected the \"Baltimore chop\", in which he would chop the ball into the ground hard enough to cause a high bounce, which enabled him to reach first base before a fielder could glove the ball and throw him out. Bill James has speculated that Keeler introduced the hit and run strategy to the original Orioles and teammate John McGraw. In James' theory, Boston's Tommy McCarthy was the first manager to make wide use of the hit and run. McCarthy then taught it to John Montgomery Ward, who taught it to Keeler.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "In forming the powerful original Baltimore Orioles of the late 19th century, manager Ned Hanlon was given an ownership stake in the team and a free rein to form his team. In one of the most one-sided trades in baseball history, Hanlon obtained Dan Brouthers and Keeler from Brooklyn in exchange for Billy Shindle and George Treadway. Keeler and six of his teammates from the Orioles eventually were inducted into the Hall of Fame.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1897, Keeler had a 44-game hitting streak to start the season, beating out the previous single season record of 42, set by Bill Dahlen. Keeler had a hit in his final game of the 1896 season, giving him a National League-record 45-game hitting streak. This mark was surpassed by Joe DiMaggio in 1941, who had a 56-game hitting streak. In 1978, Pete Rose tied Keeler's single season mark of 44 games. No other player in baseball has ever matched this feat. Keeler also had eight consecutive seasons with 200 hits or more, a record broken by Ichiro Suzuki in 2009.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1901, when Ban Johnson formed the American League, one of the first acts was to raid the National League and offer their stars big contracts. In 1901, Keeler received offers from six of the eight new American League clubs, including an offer from Chicago for two years at $4,300 a season ($129,499 in current dollar terms). Keeler remained in Brooklyn and did not actually jump to the new league until 1903, when he signed with the New York Highlanders (later renamed the Yankees in 1913). In 1905, Keeler set the Yankees team record for most sacrifice hits in a season with 42.[8] He remained with the Highlanders through 1909, and played the 1910 season with the New York Giants. Keeler played in 1911 for the Eastern League's Toronto Maple Leafs, and had 43 hits in 39 games.\n",
      "\n",
      "After his retirement, Keeler was a scout and coach for the Superbas and the Boston Braves, as well as Brooklyn's Federal League team, the Tip-Tops. He was wealthy after retiring as a player, and invested in mining companies, real estate, and other ventures. His real estate lost value in the post-World War I economic recession, and by the time of his death, his brothers and he had to sell their childhood home.\n",

      "Keeler suffered from tuberculosis and endocarditis for the last five years of his life. By late 1922, his condition had worsened and whether he would live into the new year was doubtful. Seriously ill by New Year's Eve, he heard bells and sirens in the streets when the new year arrived. Keeler sat up and said to his brother, \"You see, the new year is here and so am I—still.\"[9] He enjoyed a drink and a smoke, then said that he was ready for a long sleep.[9] A short time later, Keeler died; he was 50.[10] He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York.\n",

This went on until the recipient saw that three women with younger, prettier faces than the one his member was stuffed in were watching his fellatio session, agog. He removed himself, zipped up and sauntered over. “Mind if I join you guys?” he asked. “Sure,” we each said. It seemed rude to say no.

The Prime Minister meets members of the French-Australian business community at the Australian Embassy in Paris. Credit:Andrew Meares Asked directly if he agreed with Mr Turnbull's criticism of Mr Jones as a bomb-thrower doing the Labor party's work, and the claim that Mr Jones and Mr Bolt were running a concerted campaign against Mr Turnbull, Mr Abbott replied \"no\". \"Alan is a friend of mine, Andrew Bolt is a friend of mine, I think that they are both very significant commentators and they've got a lot to say as you know,\" he said in Paris. The comments came despite Mr Bolt accusing Mr Turnbull of destabilising Mr Abbott, and Mr Jones claiming Mr Turnbull was a bomb thrower intent on harming his prime minister in order to regain the Liberal leadership, to which Mr Turnbull responded: ''You are the bomb thrower, Alan''.\n",
      "\n",
      "On ABC's 7.30 on Thursday night, Mr Turnbull said he did not have \"any plans, any desires, any expectations to be the leader\" of his party again. \"Politics is an unpredictable business so people say to me often, 'Do you think you'll be leader again?' and I say my prospects are somewhere between nil and very negligible and I think that is probably about right,\" Mr Turnbull said on 7.30. However when asked directly about his leadership ambitions, he said he \"didn't think there is any member of the House of Representatives who, if in the right circumstances, would not take on that responsibility\". With the stoush raging on, Mr Abbott, who is in Paris, also poured cold water on suggestions emanating from within the Coalition that it might hasten a reshuffle of the ministry. \"If you look at my record, you'll know that I don't lightly reshuffle my front bench, I made hardly any changes in 2009, we made modest changes after the 2010 election, and there were modest changes after the 2013 election because I believe that you should pick the right person for the job, and then leave them there to get on with it,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fairfax Media understands that Bolt and Jones have asked Labor for ammunition to use against Mr Turnbull, particularly in relation to his stewardship of the national broadband network. At the same time, some of Mr Turnbull's allies are privately blaming the Prime Minister's office for intervening to stop a succession of high-profile appearances on the ABC since the budget. Bolt and Jones have both taken aim at Mr Turnbull for allegedly not selling the budget to the public, an accusation Mr Turnbull has rejected. In a fiery morning exchange on Thursday, Mr Turnbull accused Jones and Bolt of creating the furore around his alleged leadership aspirations, telling Jones he was the ''bomb thrower''. Jones responded: ''There is no challenge to his leadership. They are suggesting Malcolm precisely because you have no hope ever of being the leader. You've got to get that into your head.''\n",

      "Mr Turnbull replied: ''This is the most united, cohesive government we've had in this country for a long time and I think it is just very sad that you and Bolt are doing the work of the Labor Party in undermining the Abbott government.'' But questions linger over the strength of the relationship between Mr Turnbull and the Prime Minister after Fairfax Media revealed Mr Turnbull had not gone ahead with four slated appearances on the ABC. During Mr Turnbull's appearance on 7.30, he said Bolt and Jones had undermined the Prime Minister by suggesting the government was divided. \"I will not stand by and let that falsehood be peddled because there is a risk if you don't\n",

      "\n",
      "Two years later, the Foxes and their sullen son Ash are living in a hole. Fox, now a newspaper columnist, moves the family into a better home in the base of a tree, ignoring the warnings of his lawyer Badger about how dangerous the area is for foxes. The tree is located very close to facilities run by three farmers: Walter Boggis, Nathan Bunce, and Franklin Bean.\n",

      "Soon after the Foxes move in, Felicity's nephew Kristofferson Silverfox comes to live with them, as his father has fallen ill with double pneumonia. Ash finds this situation intolerable; his soft-spoken cousin is apparently superior to him at almost everything, and everyone–including Fox and Ash's female fox friend, Agnes–is charmed by Kristofferson at Ash's expense. Longing for his days as a thief, Fox and his friend Kylie Opossum steal produce and poultry from the three farms.\n",

      "Angered, the farmers decide to kill Fox. They camp out near his home. When Fox emerges, the farmers open fire, but only shoot off his tail. They then attempt to dig Fox out. After demolishing the site of the tree, the farmers discover the Foxes have dug an escape tunnel. Reasoning that the Foxes will have to surface for food and water eventually, the farmers wait at the tunnel mouth. Underground, Felicity is upset that Fox returned to his thieving ways.

      "There are a number of confidential issues in the GNC’s construction plans, as there are in any large-scale business projects. Making sense of these intricacies is difficult for even the most experienced third-party analysts. An important provider of regional support for the GNC is Venezuela, which is increasing its volume of oil supplies to China. Every now and then, Rafael Ramírez, Venezuela’s energy minister, issues politically correct statements on maintaining the volume of oil exports to China, while at the same time statements that are making Washington uneasy can be heard from the mouths of Venezuelans: «We are selling oil to China because it is the second-largest economy in the world and soon it will be the largest. While the US and Europe are in crisis, the Chinese economy continues to grow». Oil experts are interpreting Ramirez’s words like this: China will eventually become the main importer of Venezuelan oil, both heavy crude oil and light crude oil. Preparation for this is under way, as evidenced by China’s programme for the construction of large-capacity tankers for the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA. The first of four «Carabobo» VLCC-class tankers with a capacity of 320,000 deadweight tons was launched in September 2012. Tankers of this class can carry up to two million barrels of oil in a single voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Panama Canal, which was designed for vessels with a maximum capacity of up to 130,000 deadweight tons, cannot cope with the intensity of modern-day interoceanic traffic. Work is being carried out at an increased rate to widen the canal for the passage of higher-tonnage vessels. This is unlikely to provide a satisfactory solution, however. The reconstruction of the canal currently under way will allow for the passage of vessels with a capacity of up to 170,000 tons, but there are already hundreds of vessels in existence today that would be unable to use it. In the future, the number of large-capacity tankers (up to 250,000 tons and more) will increase tenfold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nicaraguan Canal will further promote trade and economic ties between countries in Latin America and the BRICS group of countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and the Republic of South Africa). The realisation of the Nicaraguan megaproject will be yet further confirmation that Washington’s positions in Latin America are weakening, and that the region is being fiercely infiltrated by other powers, competition from which is neutralising the hegemonic claims of the US. And this is not happening just anywhere, but in those territories that were previously considered to be the Empire’s back yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US Administration is trying to break this trend and create new alliances like the Pacific Alliance in order to undermine the processes of Latin American integration. It is also promising soft forms of cooperation with NATO to its closest allies, as happened with Colombia. The various methods of weakening, and in the long term removing, the authority of the Sandinista government have been miscalculated. In order to solve this issue, one of the largest US embassies in the Western Hemisphere has been set up in Nicaragua. It is headed by Phyllis Powers, who has experience of working in Panama.\n",

An exceptional amount of attention is being paid to the development of recommendations on how to compromise the project, the preparation of ideas for the introduction of propaganda campaigns regarding its lack of potential and its unprofitability, and so forth.\n",

      "Looking at Philadelphia CeaseFire, it’s hard not to feel like Slutkin’s rhetoric about Ipods and vinyl records and global game changers is getting ahead of itself. Strictly grassroots and thinly funded, the program comprises a street outreach team (and paid staff) of only four people, led by Executive Director Marla Davis Bellamy. Working out of a small office space on Temple University’s campus, the program uses volunteer undergraduate criminal justice majors for extra manpower to help locate social services for its clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "An attorney with experience in public health, Davis Bellamy holds dual appointment at Temple University’s law and medical schools and has an advanced degree in government administration from the University of Pennsylvania. Her outreach team brings the typical mix of CeaseFire street wisdom and deep neighborhood intelligence to the table. More than that, team members are hungry for results, relentlessly canvassing the neighborhoods where they work, while Davis Bellamy pushes hard to make political inroads with the city’s top brass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The program was piloted in the North Central Philadelphia’s 22nd Police District, a desperately poor and persistently violent stretch of land, pocked with crack cocaine corners and dense with urban blight. Davis Bellamy is quick to point out that, of the rash of murders back in January, “only one of those was in the area we’ve been working in.” Like Slutkin’s conclusion about Chicago’s recent violence, Davis Bellamy believes there are similar indications that the program is already making a difference, with Philadelphia’s most violent police district appearing to have largely bucked the recent trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Philly’s violence hot spots remain numerous, spread across a vast territory encompassing multiple neighborhoods and ethnic groups. How do a team of four and a single director get their arms around this?\n",
      "\n",
      "“By being persistent, man,” says Terry Starks, tall and stocky in a bright orange CeaseFire outreach worker sweatshirt that matches his henna-dyed Muslim’s beard. “People in the neighborhood have been disappointed before [by social programs]. At the scene of a shooting they’ll ask us, ‘Is this the only time I’m gonna see your face?’ That’s why we’re out there every day, we call our clients every day, we’re constantly checking on them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Starks, a onetime gunshot victim who spent much of the last fifteen years bouncing in and out of jail on a host of drug and other charges, including attempted murder (ultimately withdrawn), agrees with Dr. Webster’s assertion that there’s a pent-up demand for this type of intervention. In Philly, he says, the CeaseFire team is welcomed in places where cops are not and has easily made connections, despite a pervasive Stop Snitching street code in North Philly—long derided by police and politicians as a cancer on the city—where sharing any information about a person’s drug operations or criminal involvement is nearly certain to result in violent retaliation. Witness intimidation has plagued city courts, hindering the District Attorney’s ability to get convictions against violent criminals. Threats against those who would cooperate with authorities are scrawled in graffiti all over the city’s hottest drug corners.\n",

      "1 Lingard shows importance of offball movement\n",
      "\n",
      "In celebration of what is apparently Jesse Lingard week, it seems an apt time to share one takeaway I had from his breakout against West Bromwich Albion: his off-ball movement is more useful to this current United side than anything Memphis Depay can do on the ball. To quote Dutch legend Johan Cruyff:\n",
      "\n",
      "When you play a match, it is statistically proven that players actually have the ball 3 minutes on average … So, the most important thing is: what do you do during those 87 minutes when you do not have the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester United have been criticised for their stagnant attack, most recently by Paul Scholes. How do you fix it? Off-ball movement! I talked about it last week with Riyad Mahrez and how it has transformed his game. Depay, I have no doubt, is a more talented player than Lingard and may supplant him by May. But Lingard without the ball is showing a little more willingness right now that Depay hasn’t. It manifests itself in fantasy as well, where we constantly see players who we perceive as more talented struggle to get games. Lamela was one who had this issue when he joined Spurs two years ago but is enjoying a promising campaign so far.\n",

      "The Transition and Intentional Communities movements offer pathways to recovery from an abusive, extractive growth-economy. Their proponents seek wholeness through cooperation.

      "These natural disasters caused severe damaged to 4 of the 6 reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, leaving them without functioning primary, secondary, or tertiary cooling systems. The resulting partial meltdown of the core at one reactor and of a waste fuel rod storage tank in another has resulted in the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere, soil, and water, forcing the evacuation of what was at first a 12-mile radius and now a 19-mile radius surrounding the facility.\n",

      "Though reactors in the United States are built to strict safety standards, they are nevertheless vulnerable to any number of natural and manmade disasters, from earthquakes and tsunamis to flash floods, droughts, and hurricanes. U.S. reactor safety standards have been effective in preventing catastrophe, though a recent report highlights 14 “near misses” where improperly implemented safety protocols nearly caused major problems. More troublingly, many of these standards were based on an understanding of our climate system that is now 40 years out of date. Today we know that climate change is making floods, droughts, and hurricanes stronger and more frequent, which means we must ask whether our safety standards, even when followed perfectly, are enough to prevent disaster.\n",

They supply roughly 20 percent of the country’s total electricity needs. Nuclear plants demand large sources of water in order to cool and control the core temperatures of the reactors that power them. To meet this inevitable requirement, nuclear plants are situated in low-lying areas near rivers and lakes, and many others are built on the coasts. This proximity leaves these plants vulnerable to floods and other water-related disasters. (See our map below.)\n",

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, oversees licensing applications, reactor specifications, and radioactive waste disposal. The Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, or ACRS, also reviews the adequacy of proposed safety standards and creates individualized specifications to withstand the projected worst-case disasters for each plant location.

      "MacArthur Park station, which should be fully operational by the end of May. Flywheels, mechanical devices that store rotational energy, are an old technology that is starting to come back into vogue for some applications, and the company’s president, Frank DeLattre, says they carry several advantages over batteries. “Large amounts of regenerated electrical energy from the train can be turned to kinetic energy for storage in the flywheel in a short period of time,” he says. “This is key for electric rail, as each braking train can generate two to six megajoules of energy…over a 15- to 20-second braking period.” That’s approaching two kilowatt-hours, or about half of what your iPhone uses in a full year, every time a train pulls into a station. Battery banks that can charge and discharge that quickly, DeLattre says, would have very short life spans: “The flywheels can provide hundreds of thousands of cycles, without loss of energy-storage performance, making them ideal for this application.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Westlake–MacArthur Park project was funded by a federal grant of $4.46 million, and the hope is that the two-megawatt system will save as much as 400 megawatt-hours per year—the electricity consumption of about 40 average homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up the coast in Portland, Ore., a city long known for its green tendencies, yet another storage option is taking hold. The new Portland–Milwaukie Light Rail Transit Project line will feature supercapacitors to make use of the electricity from regenerative braking. Supercapacitors have a much higher energy density than batteries, meaning they can charge and discharge extremely quickly; this is useful to meet quick spikes in electricity demand on the rail system. They also can cycle millions of times without degrading whereas batteries have shelf lives on the order of tens of thousands of cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The specifics of a given transit system will likely determine which idea works best, and sometimes even a combination may be in order. Gillespie says that the next installation in Philadelphia, at Griscom substation toward the end of the Market–Frankford line, will combine the lithium ion batteries with a supercapacitor. This will erase a 20 percent shortfall in potential revenue that SEPTA suffered in its first attempt largely due to the somewhat slow energy response time of its batteries (in seconds, rather than milliseconds for a supercapacitor). The hope is to eventually have 10 substations with energy-storage capacity generating enough savings and revenue to finance an expansion of the transit system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a 2013 paper on the various technologies available three Newcastle University engineering professors in England noted that on the whole most transit systems could likely reduce their energy usage by 15 to 30 percent with some version of these ideas. That’s a lot of dollars, a lot of megawatts and a lot of tons of carbon dioxide, so many other cities are taking note. DeLattre says Vycon has been in talks with several transit authorities in the U.S. as well as in China and South Korea, and Gillespie has spoken with counterparts in Chicago, Boston and cities in Spain about SEPTA’s experience. He doesn’t think it will stop there either.\n",

First, there is no more ‘coal-from-Newcastle,’ as cheaper imports into the UK are available from countries as far away as Australia and South Africa. Second, the UK is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the EU. However, after years of being a net exporter of both fuels, the UK became a net importer of natural gas in 2004. Government estimates also predict that the country will become a net importer of oil in the near-to-mid-term future. Third, as far back as 2006, then Secretary of State for Energy Malcolm Wicks warned that the UK was on a course to lose 30% of its generating capacity from coal and nuclear over the next 15 years as these plants close down. It is no wonder then why energy and security of energy supply, understood largely as electric power in the UK, has risen to the top of the agenda across political, economic, energy and national defense agendas.\n",

And so, the team have announced they’ll stop distributing the tool. I’m sure it’ll still float around the Internet unofficially, but this is a terrible loss.OpenIV is the tool people use to fiddle in GTA’s data files, changing and adding models, textures, and other assets. Not every mod uses OpenIV but Take-Two shutting it down is a huge blow to GTA modding. It’s a modding scene which creates everything from movie-making to gang wars and Iron Man.\n",

That tool would require copies of both games as it’s a converter rather than a conversion. But perhaps smooshing games together tipped The Suits over the edge, sending them into a blood rage.

He felt that Pasadena had swollen into a stifling and crowded suburb. The ranch, which the Burnhams called La Cuesta, offered them privacy, space, and some very well-deserved peace. The phase of Burnham’s life that had included the hippo hearing, seven years earlier, had been busy and stressful. While the New Food Supply Society was struggling to get off the ground, he was also traveling back and forth between Mexico and California, establishing copper mines and irrigation projects in the Yaqui Valley for a number of financiers, including the Guggenheim family, J. P. Morgan, and John Hays Hammond, a mining baron he befriended during his days in Rhodesia. Burnham considered Mexico “the most active region left in the world”—the next unruly frontier, rich with opportunities—and he was drawn to it just as he’d been drawn to the Southwest as a boy and Africa as a young man. But Mexico, too, eventually burst into violence. And when the Mexican Revolution began, in 1910, Burnham was called down to watch over Hammond’s interests; at one point, he would command an encampment of 500 armed men on the banks of the Yaqui. The move to La Cuesta ranch presented him with yet another empty frontier to master and improve—but a tranquil one, on a smaller scale, far removed from any geopolitical violence. He imported white-tailed deer from Mexico and took pride in how they prospered. He introduced wild turkeys, peccaries, pheasants, and game bantams. The Burnhams were part of a small community of settlers living deep in the Sierras, widely dispersed—people who worked hard and made do on their own. Burnham thought of them as a “lost white tribe.” “When the World War broke,” he remembered, “it was some time before the reality of it penetrated into our deep canyon.” But when it did, the lost tribe sprang into action. Young men filed out of the mountains to enlist and fight. “Elderly women walked four miles in the heat of summer over dusty mountain roads to knit and sew for soldiers over seas,” he wrote. This determination reassured Burnham. Otherwise, he was unsettled by the war. The new technological mode of warfare—the gassing, machine guns, and trenches—had “turned us all into military robots,” he wrote. He argued that the traditional skills and ethos of self-reliance that those old scouts had taught him as a boy remained as important as ever, and he worried that they were being lost. Self-reliance was becoming an obsession of Burnham’s—the only sensible response to the growing disorder of the world. In the run-up to the war, he’d been extremely sympathetic to the so-called Preparedness Movement in America—the belief that conflict was inevitable and that President Woodrow Wilson wasn’t building a sufficiently large and capable military to handle it. Burnham and his friends traded letters about “Preparedness,” extolling it as an ideal, griping about the glaring unpreparedness of those around them. And in July of 1916, Burnham was listed as a grand marshal’s assistant in San Francisco’s Preparedness Day Parade. The parade would be a stunning display of civic preparedness, featuring more than 50,000 marchers: 200 nurses in uniform; 500 physicians and surgeons; 200 optometrists and opticians, prepared to help the nation’s eyes; a vaudevillian actress, dressed as the Goddess of Preparedness; and a Division of Six-Footers, which was essentially a few rows\n",

They are the older, predominantly Jewish population—numbering now perhaps 100,000 out of a total TK population —whose families had been persecuted and sometimes murdered during the Nazi occupation and sometimes by Hitler’s Hungarian collaborators. Hungarian Jews often viewed Stalin’s armies and the Soviet victory as a godsend. Indeed, Jews, including family members of mine, were heavily involved in two brutal communist dictatorships in Hungary, the first under Bela Kun (Kohn) 1919-1920 and the second under the Stalinist dictatorship of Matyas Rakosi (né Rosenfeld) 1945-1956. Wikipedia refers to these murderers as “atheists,” but they were ethnically Jewish. In Hungary the involvement of Jews in Communist regimes has inevitably generated anti-Semitism, which was already apparent in the uprising in 1956. Although the Israeli historian Jacob Talmon and Richard Pipes discuss this problem in their books, Wikipedia tries to ignore it and dwells on Christian and fascist anti-Semitism among the Magyars\n",

A little while ago, the show I remembered from my TGIF-watchin' youth came to The Disney Channel. For a long time, I watched it. Then, I began writing down brief opinions and summaries on some of the episodes from memory. Finally, my obsession entered a new stage. I taped several late-night episodes while I slept and then watched the tapes the next day, pausing frequently to be sure I got every detail, every highlight.

      "The trouble was that a vast audience, though it was an endorsement of Guardian journalism, wasn't in itself the business model that GMG executives imagined it to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The problem with reach is that it can breed complacency,” Pemsel says now. “You can look around the building and you've got screens with big [audience] numbers and monthly dashboards going out saying ‘Hey, we’ve got bigger’. But it masks the relationship you are cultivating with your readers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He points out that “some of the most atrocious content companies in the world can be big, it doesn't mean that you are being read or making an impact on the world…it just means you are big”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pemsel says that, as commercial boss, he was starting to monetise the Guardian’s online audience when “a huge swing to programmatic” advertising, led by Google and Facebook, meant that the “the connection between digital reach and revenue snapped”.\n",
      "\n",
      "So GMG has had to learn to think beyond reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advertising downturn coincided with Viner taking over from Rusbridger, and Pemsel being promoted to CEO in a relationship that, due to the dire financial position, has led to the Guardian's editorial and commercial teams working more closely than ever before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emphasising the “agility” that this arrangement brings, Pemsel says the approach is essential to maximising the value of reader relationships. “If you are going to put the reader at the heart of everything, you need to have a common data set and a common understanding of reader journey to know what parts of the site can be optimised to deliver reader relationships [and] reader revenue. You can't do that in silos.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The break even strategy has been about saving money as well as making it. Viner and Pemsel have overseen a programme of deep cuts that has seen the loss of more than 300 posts. “It was incredibly tough but we have said that we will break even and we will,” he insists.\n",

      "Converting readers into members\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategic transition from reach to reader relationships is known within GMG’s building at King’s Cross in London as “anonymous to known”.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Guardian first announced its three-tier (rising to £60-a-month) membership scheme in late 2014, shortly before Rusbridger announced he would be standing down as editor, many of the paper’s rivals sniggered at its presumptions of reader loyalty. But while there have been errors – a plan to use a Grade II listed railway warehouse as an events hub was scrapped – the latest figures are a vindication of the idea, which gives members benefits such as exclusive emails and ad-free reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pemsel has no compunction in using inclusive language such as “contributor” or “supporter” to encourage payments from readers who were once encouraged to expect free access to a publisher that would be funded by advertising. He notes that the “most transactional” publishers (think of News UK) are now using the term “member” in their marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest group of Guardian members is, unsurprisingly, from the UK, although there is a sizeable cohort from the US. Pemsel is bullish about the prospect of making even more money from this scheme and from one-off donors. “We are at the foothills of genuinely exploring how far that strategy can take us,” he says. “We have got 160 million browsers at the top of our funnel and we are doing a lot of strategic analysis of our data to work out how many regulars we have, and on the conversion of the number of people we have got a paying relationship with. We have got a long way to go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He credits chief customer office Anna Bateson, and her predecessor David Magliano, with playing key roles in driving reader contributions. “In partnership with people in editorial, our data teams are now working out the most scientific way to optimise by article and by country and by genre, the most efficient way to be able to drive reader support,” he says.\n",

      "The previous presence of Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales on the Guardian’s board has helped to generate insights into how the online encyclopedia harnesses financial support from its user community. “It's interesting to listen to Jimmy’s vision of Wikipedia, and how they have worked out some incredibly technical and scientific ways to optimise for support.

Many people cave in and say, go head. Even if you have nothing to hide, you should never give consent to a search of your person or vehicle. Not only is it an affront to your dignity and an assault on your most basic rights as a human being, it’s a fact that some cops are corrupt and more than a few have been caught (later) planting “evidence” in people’s cars, such as a small amount of pot — in order to seize the vehicle under asset forfeiture laws.\n",

      "\n",
      "For years now, customers have been begging HBO to offer a standalone streaming service. Instead, customers got HBO Go , a streaming service only accessible if you can prove you have traditional cable. HBO Go is part of the cable and broadcast industry's \"TV Everywhere\" initiative -- or the industry's misguided belief that you can thwart cord cutting by building giant walled gardens firmly tethered to traditional cable. Of course this does nothing to actually thwart cord cutting, and only drives customers unwilling to pay cable's endlessly-soaring rates to piracy For many years, HBO was hesitant to offer a truly stand alone streaming service, fearing disruption of the cozy, promotion and subsidy-laden relationships it has with cable operators. Late last year HBO finally announced it would offer a standalone HBO service , but didn't provide any hard details.The good news? HBO has formally announced that it's launching \"HBO Now\" next month for a $15 monthly fee. The bad news (for some)? The service is going to be an Apple exclusive at launch, meaning that while you can access the service via iOS devices, you're out of luck if you'd like to use the service on a game console, Roku player, Chromecast, or any of the myriad other competing streaming devices. And while you will be able to watch HBO Now content via the new website and any old browser, you can apparently only register for the service using Apple's HBO Now app and an iOS device This resulted in many people correctly noting customers are being herded from one walled garden to another:The press release can't be bothered to mention this, but the exclusive is only for three months , after which HBO Now will be made available on all the usual platforms. Cable providers may also jump in and pitch the service, though many will likely worry they'll only act to cannibalize existing cable subscribers. In other words, we're not exactly talking about the end of the world here, and HBO Now is still part of a welcome sea change toward more standalone streaming options in 2015. If you're still annoyed, just pretend Apple users are beta-testing the service and ironing out the wrinkles ahead of your arrival this summer.Still, while the exclusive surely nets Apple a nice cash payout, being greeted by a giant wall isn't a great first HBO Now brand impression for Android, Xbox, Playstation, Chromecast or Roku users. Being greeted by that same giant wall also isn't going to do much to keep the \" most pirated TV show on television \" from being downloaded via BitTorrent. HBO Now's still a welcome change\n",

It also doesn’t help that they all seemingly want to forget their pasts, so even once you have found them, getting them to admit who they are and divulge any information takes some work. Like a true detective then, gathering evidence to use as leverage is a must, and once you’ve finally got all the dirt you need to make them open up you can really step up your investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst generally a laid back experience, Root Letter’s one-on-one investigation sequences deliver some strenuous moments where your perception and powers of deduction are reasonably tested. Faced with individuals that really don’t want to spill the beans, they require you to give real thought as to which questions you should ask and what evidence to present at the right time in order to manipulate the flow of conversation. Ruin the flow of dialogue by selecting the wrong option six times and you’ll have to start again from the beginning. On paper, it sounds like these sequences could be rather irritating should you fail, but luckily, they’re rarely that taxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I found Root Letter‘s weakest aspect to be its “Max Time” instances, occurring mainly, but not exclusively, during the aforementioned investigation sequences. Challenging you to stop an on-screen gauge in the section associated with the response you believe is the most appropriate for the situation, the random movements of the gauge can annoy, and being forced to repeat the exercise until you’ve selected the right response renders the whole process fairly pointless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst i’m being down on Root Letter for the moment, I should also note my disappointment that there’s the odd localisation issue here and there. An errant space in the middle of a word, the occasional instance of a poor translation, and even a sentence that was unfinished are just a few examples that spring to mind. Admittedly, they didn’t really ruin my ability to enjoy Root Letter at all, but they shouldn’t exist in something so reliant on its writing. I also found it strange that Aya refers to most of her friends using nicknames that aren’t particularly loving, such as Bitch, Fatty and Four Eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all’s said and done though, what holds Root Letter together is its thoroughly captivating story that keeps you hooked from start to finish. Right from the get-go you’re trapped in an alluring mystery that only deepens as you uncover a web of lies and deceit. It’s well paced, spurring you on to find the next piece of evidence required to eke the truth out of your next victim, and with elements of the paranormal and science fiction thrown in for good measure, you never really know where the story is going to go. What’s more, it is well-presented, with fantastic artwork used throughout to bring each of the characters’ personalities to life, and an absorbing soundtrack that perfectly sets the mood for each scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "With five endings to aim for, amounting to around 50 hours of gameplay, Root Letter is great for anyone that loves a good mystery. Obviously it’s not action-packed – this is a visual novel after all – but just like a good book it keeps you on tenterhooks from beginning to end, eager to find out exactly what happened all those years ago and the implications it may have in the present day. Those looking for a Phoenix Wright-style experience on PS4 should look no further – Root Letter scratches the itch whilst also presenting a more compelling and mature story.\n",

      "Root Letter is available on PS4 and PS Vita. We reviewed the PS4 versionHow do you do, fellow kids? Have you heard of the dab?

But even though Cone was as dominant as anyone to ever wear a Kansas City uniform, he pitched fewer than 450 innings for Kansas City, and that takes him out of the discussion for being anything more than a spot starter on a good pitching staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the offense after George Brett, the next strongest position for the Royals is catcher. Most may not think of Mike Sweeney as a catcher, but Sweeney caught 201 games for the Royals. With John Mayberry entrenched at first base, there isn’t much need for Sweeney to play there,and Sweeney provides enough offensive value to switch off between platooning for Darrell Porter and being a DH against righties.\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s a good thing the Royals are so loaded when it comes to pitching, because the offense leaves a lot to be desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up the middle the Royals feature maybe the worst middle infield of any of the all-time teams. Freddie Patek and Frank White may have been mainstays for the Royals during the ’70s and ’80s, but a career OPS+ of under 90 does not bode well in a league where teams can go three, four or even five Hall of Famers deep. Such is the case with White and Patek.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Royals don’t get much help from the bench in that department, either. Jose Offerman and Alcides Escobar are little more than the best of a bad bunch in terms of the talent you need to be at to have an impact on the league.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outfield is a bit better, but it’s still well below the average of what other teams will be featuring. This is where the loss of Beltrán is noticeable. Instead of having a borderline five-tool outfielder in right field to go with Alex Gordon and Willie Wilson, the Royals have to go with Danny Tartabull.\n",
      "\n",
      "Offensively it’s pretty much a push between the two, with Tartabull having led the league in slugging in ’91, the only Royal not named George Brett to do it, but defensively the difference couldn’t be more stark. Tartabull would be a top candidate for the worst defensive regular starter in either league, and if he were not able to justify his shortcomings with the bat, I would not hesitate to call up the more well-rounded Jermaine Dye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one silver lining is that with Alex Gordon, Amos Otis and Willie Wilson all on the team, the Royals should have at least one Gold Glove caliber outfielder to turn to for a late-game defensive substitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this, the Royals lineup winds up being very top heavy; aside from Brett, there is no dominant offensive player.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of righty/lefty match-ups, the Royals are relatively equal on both sides. The overall lineup is righty heavy, but Brett would not be in the Hall of Fame if he carried the same numbers against right-handed pitchers that he did aganst lefties. This isn’t to say Brett was terrible against lefties, he was just not as impressive. His 3,000 career hits should tell you just how great he was against righties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 36 teams that will be featured, 35 have their best relief pitcher listed as the closer. The Royals are the exception. I would expect stiff competition all year from Oakland and Minnesota which, like Kansas City, will also feature a pretty solid rotation, but few bullpens can come close to Kansas City’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it was during his career, a lot of the weight is going to fall on Brett to carry the offense. As he goes I would expect the Royals to go, but for the team to succeed, somebody else on that offense would need to step up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I would consider the Royals the worst team with a chance to win the World Series in this all-time league, and it’s because of the bullpen. To be clear, the list of teams that could realistically win the World Series also includes the Red Sox, the Reds, the Indians, the LA Dodgers and the Phillies. among. others. I don’t think they will do it, but I could envision the scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most part, on a team like the Royals, a starter doesn’t need to go more than five innings. That’s probably all Charlie\n",

      "\"Most weather modification is about creating precipitation, because we don't have enough drinking water and we don't have enough water for irrigation,\" says Kallmyer, who did intensive research into weather modification, including building a relationship with North American Weather Consultants, a weather modification service based in Utah. \"There's all these old folkloric traditions. Usually they involve stripping a young girl naked, putting her in the outskirts or center of the city, and then having her pour water on the ground.

'The Department' wants to leave people in a more mindful, mystical relationship with the weather itself.\"\n",

A tipster in Kansas City has since sent word, with numbers, that indicates the Chiefs are doing basically the same thing next door at Arrowhead Stadium.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tipster explained that both stadiums generate tax revenues that are put into a fund that also draws money from a county sales tax and contributions from the city and the state. That fund is used first to pay debt service on the $500 million bond floated for the recent upgrades to both Kauffman and Arrowhead stadiums. The teams then get reimbursed by the fund for repairs, maintenance, management, and operations (RMMO) expenses. The idea was pitched with the understanding that most of that RMMO money would be used for maintenance and repair. But both the Royals and Chiefs aren't doing that; they instead appear to be taking advantage of an amendment added to the stadiums' lease agreement in January 2006 that allows the RMMO funds to be used for \"event day operations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the documents obtained by WHB radio, the Royals used just nine percent of the $17 million in RMMO funds they've requested in the last five years for maintenance and repair, with some of the money being used to cover payroll taxes. The documents sent to us by our tipster show that the Chiefs have used just 33 percent of the $27.3 million they asked to have reimbursed during the same time period for maintenance and repair. What that means is that both franchises are using most of the taxpayer money they're getting to reduce the cost of running their teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when you look at what the Chiefs have made reimbursement requests for this year, according to the info sent to us by our tipster, it gets even worse: The Chiefs have asked for more than $9 million since May 25, with just $546,000—a paltry six percent—going toward maintenance and repair. That money, the tipster said, has been approved by the Jackson County Sports Complex Authority, which oversees the operations of both stadiums, though it hasn't yet been disbursed.\n",

We personally were planning to buy tickets to one of the games that Dan Connolly and talk radio have been bitching about, but a $15 left field nosebleed increases to $22.50 after fees are levied.

Then too, when a fan watches a game they’re not watching only one particular game, Boston in August, as it were. We’re watching in our mind’s eye every game we’ve ever attended. When we watch from the stands, we can still see Ripken and Brian Roberts, Brady Anderson and every other player we’ve ever watched live.

      " their livelihoods are not completely dependent on the wage, something which happened, for example, in Northern Italy a few decades ago. Thus, the relation between capitalism and the commons is always a question of power relations in a specific historic context.\n",

      "The Role And Reactions Of The State\n",
      "\n",
      "An Architektur: How would you evaluate the importance of the commons today? Would you say that the current financial and economic crisis and the concomitant delegitimation of the neoliberal model brought forward, at least to a certain extent, the discussion and practice of the commons? And what are the respective reactions of the authorities and of capitalism?\n",
      "\n",
      "Massimo De Angelis: In every moment of crisis we see an emergence of commons to address questions of livelihood in one way or the other. During the crisis of the 1980s in Britain there was the emergence of squatting, alternative markets, or so called Local Exchange Trading Systems, things that also came up in the crisis in Argentina in 2001.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the form in which capitalism reacts and reproduces itself in relation to the emergence of commoning, three main processes can be observed. First, the criminalization of alternatives in every process of enclosure, both historically and today. Second, a temptation of the subjects fragmented by the market to return to the market. And third, a specific mode of governance that ensures the subordination of individuals, groups and their values, needs and aspirations under the market process.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Architektur: But then, how can we relate the commons and commoning to state power? Are the commons a means to overcome or fight the state or do you think they need the state to guarantee a societal structure? Would, at least in theory, the state finally be dissolved through commoning? Made useless, would it thus disappear? Stavros, could you elaborate on this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Stavros Stavrides: Sometimes we tend to ignore the fact that what happens in the struggle for commons is always related to specific situations in specific states, with their respective antagonisms. One always has to put oneself in relation to other groups in the society. And of course social antagonisms take many forms including those produced by or channeled through different social institutions. The state is not simply an engine that is out there and regulates various aspects of production or various aspects of the distribution of power. The state, I believe, is part of every social relation. It is not only a regulating mechanism but also produces a structure of institutions that mold social life. To be able to resist these dominant forms of social life we have to eventually struggle against these forces which make the state a very dominant reality in our societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In today’s world, we often interpret the process of globalization as the withering away of states, so that states are no longer important. But actually the state is the guarantor of the necessary conditions for the reproduction of the system. It is a guarantor of violence, for example, which is not a small thing. Violence, not only co-optation, is a very important means of reproducing capitalism, because by no means do we live in societies of once-and-for-all legitimated capitalist values. Instead, these values must be continuously imposed, often by force. The state is also a guarantor of property and land rights, which are no small things either, because property rights establish forms of control on various aspects of our life. Claims of property rights concern specific places that belong to certain people or establishments, which might also be international corporations. The state, therefore, is not beyond globalization; it is in fact the most specific arrangement of powers against which we can struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a Network of Resistance\n",
      "\n",
      "Stavros Stavrides: I am thus very suspicious or reserved about the idea that we can build our own small enclaves of otherness, our small liberated strongholds that could protect us from the power of the state. I don’t mean that it is not important to build communities of resistance, but rather than framing them as isolated enclaves, we should attempt to see them as a potential network of resistance, collectively representing only a part of the struggle. If you tend to believe that a single community with its commons and its enclosed parameter could be a stronghold of liberated otherness, then you are bound to be defeated. You cannot avoid the destruction that comes from the power of the state and its mechanisms. Therefore, we need to produce collaborations between different communities as well as understand ourselves as belonging to not just one of these communities. We should rather understand ourselves as members of different communities in the process of emerging.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Architektur: But how can it be organized? What could this finally look like?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I think the ratings story has been told, and it’s real. MTV was off by 24% among its traditional 12-34 audience this past fourth quarter. I think what we’re seeing now is a bit of an identity crisis — not uncommon when a network is looking to shake things up and reinvent itself,” said Brian Hughes, senior VP of audience analysis at Magna Global, the large media investment unit of Interpublic Group. “It feels like the days of ‘Music Television’ are long over, but I guess the question is what the ‘M’ will stand for going forward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "MTV’s new president thinks he has hit upon an answer. “This is a brand that has always been about elevating youth voices, artists and creators, a brand that was born from music and pop culture. We want to remember that heritage and reinvigorate that creative spark around those precepts,” said Sean Atkins, a former digital executive at Discovery Communications who arrived at MTV this past fall. “MTV News is the first place for this kind of refocus.”\n",
      "\n",
      "MTV News made a name for itself in its earlier days by examining everything from gay marriage to eating disorders, and energized its base so much that politicians and candidates for office had to make a stop at the network as part of campaigns. President Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, Senator John McCain, former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former governor Mike Huckabee and former governor Mitt Romney are among the elected officials who have given interviews to MTV over the years. Dave Sirulnick, who supervised MTV News and rose to executive vice president of news, documentaries and specials for MTV, left the network last year in the wake of a restructuring effort at Viacom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pop-culture aficionados won’t be the only ones watching to see if MTV’s executives get the formula right. Investors and analysts have grown increasingly worried about Viacom’s ability to improve ratings at MTV and Comedy Central. MTV’s new management is “deep in a turnaround plan,” Philippe Dauman, Viacom’s chairman and chief executive, told investors on a conference call earlier this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sparking a revival isn’t a TV-only maneuver. MTV News content is meant to draw eyeballs to the company’s digital and mobile outlets as well as its linear TV network. Executives want to use MTV News to boost digital traffic “by bringing in some real editorial firepower, getting a more pointed point of view and taking quality to the next level,” said Kristin Frank, an executive vice president who oversees digital for MTV and other Viacom networks. MTV’s own site notched approximately 21.2 million unique viewers in December, according to comScore, compared with about 20.2 million in the year-earlier period and 18.4 million in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent MTV content has been more “viral” in nature, said Frank, and the company isn’t going to tamp down on those sorts of posts and articles. But there is a strong desire for “a larger point of view and better storytelling” that can result in content appropriate for everything ranging from TV to Snapchat.\n",

      "If Fierman has his way, fans will check in with MTV News a few times a day to get a “leading conversation” on the topics that are important to them. “Yes, of course we want to see every unique we have, but the goal is to certainly get people to spend more time on the site,” he said, “and have more of a relationship.”The video of the alleged scuffle between Indian and Chinese soldiers on the banks of Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh, posted online by Lt Gen Prakash Katoch (retd) on August 19, was visual confirmation of what had been reported about the incident that took place on Independence Day morning.\n",

      "This argument is fundamentally about the Army’s pervasive neglect of Manning’s known health issues, which, had they been handled properly, would have led to the removal of her access to classified material long before her leaks. This does not cease to be relevant to her case merely because one of those health issues, gender dysphoria, happens to be currently subject to cultural stigma and needless politicization.\n",

      "Kirchick blithely accuses Manning of “betraying [her] country”, yet he leaves out these relevant details of how the military failed Manning. It’s all the more galling that he uses this oversimplification to portray her defense as somehow irresponsible or damaging to the cause of LGBT equality. Her struggles were magnified, and appropriate treatment withheld, because of homophobic and transphobic policies that forced her into isolation and secrecy as a transgender woman. Acknowledging this reality does not constitute an argument against open integration and affirming care of transgender troops. It’s an argument for that. Standing behind Chelsea and her values – that we have the right to exist as our genuine selves – can hardly be said to diminish our cause’s credibility. It’s necessary to any kind of credibility that matters. ■Storage for Photographers (Part 2) How a 12TB Synology NAS changed my digital life\n",

      "Data is eating me alive. Every gadget these days can shoot photos and record video. The move to smaller but faster SSDs hasn't helped with storage. I captured 275GB of photos and videos on my last trip. Just one trip! And I'm just a hobbyist photographer with a mere 12MP camera. If you shoot with any regularity and a 20MP+ camera you'll easily be clocking more than a terabyte a year. Where on earth do normal people store that much data? The cloud?\n",

      "I first wrote about this storage struggle in 2013. If you haven't read it yet, take a quick skim first. I expressed my frustration about running out of space on my laptop's SSD and my desire to store photo previews locally but have the RAWs archived and accessible in the cloud. This would allow me to easily reference photos whenever I wanted locally and know exactly which one I needed to retrieve when necessary. Storage for Photographers A proposal for an underserved market I didn't quite get to that fantasy but I survived with a combination of Lightroom Smart Previews and Amazon Glacier with the Arq app. Whenever I needed to edit a file I could download it — well, after I waited the 4+ hour Glacier delay, usually longer if I wanted to pay less — then tell Lightroom where it was. It worked, but it was definitely not a great workflow. I began to miss casually accessing and editing older photos. In my first post I said that retrieval of RAWs was not terribly important after I had archived them. I was wrong. I began shooting more since that post. Friends and coworkers would ask me for photos I had taken of them and constantly having to find and download single remote files was annoying. Especially if I didn't have the previews in Lightroom anymore and had to download the whole set to find one shot. My storage needs\n",

I didn't believe these numbers myself until I saw them. Wilson was pretty much the best picker in the country straight up (according to our friends at Pickwatch) and the absolute worst against the spread. The real-life equivalent of this would be getting 11 phone numbers at a bar ... but then they all turn out to be fake. I think that actually happened to me once.\n",

      "The Dolphins have been the most inexplicable team in the NFL. Despite the fact that their offense is ranked dead last in total yards, they've somehow managed to come back from double-digit second-half deficits in their past two games. The Dolphins are so bad they're good, which I think makes them the Jean-Claude Van Damme of NFL teams because that basically describes every movie he made from 1989 to 1995. I don't even really like the movie \"Sudden Death\" but I watch it every time it's on TV because I can't bring myself to look away.

      " Republican National Committee. A new, data-filled study by the Harvard scholars Theda Skocpol and Alexander Hertel-Fernandez reports that the Kochs have established centralized command of a “nationally-federated, full-service, ideologically focused” machine that “operates on the scale of a national U.S. political party.” The Koch network, they conclude, acts like a “force field,” pulling Republican candidates and office-holders further to the right. Last week, the Times reported that funds from the Koch network are fuelling both ongoing rebellions against government control of Western land and the legal challenge to labor unions that is before the Supreme Court. Onstage in Wichita, Charles barely discussed his political spending. And he did not mention that, for the 2016 election cycle, he has organized a small circle of ultra-wealthy conservatives to spend nearly nine hundred million dollars on campaigns and advocacy—an unprecedented sum. The identities of the circle’s other members have remained secret. This private jackpot is more than twice the sum that was spent by the Republican National Committee in the 2012 Presidential-election race. Most of the leading Republican Presidential candidates have attended gatherings of the donor circle in the hope of winning its financial backing. The Koch brothers have been widely criticized by Democrats for their systematic attempt to use money to sway elections. In 2014, Guy Cecil, then the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, declared, “The Koch brothers are spending a fraction of their personal fortune to buy a Senate that is good for them and bad for almost every other family in America.” During the Wichita program, however, Scarborough declared such criticism of the Kochs to be outmoded. “Four or five years ago, the Koch brothers really burst on the national stage and into the national consciousness,” he said. Scarborough recalled that David, who was at the gala, “would give all this money to ballet companies that would allow ‘The Nutcracker’ to be performed, and he would go there and he’d get booed! That’s a kind of strange way to say thank you!” Scarborough went on, “But we started noticing about three years ago that New Yorkers—liberal New Yorkers!—started to feel defensive for David and Charles, and all that they’d not only done for New York but also for the country.” Scarborough, a former Republican congressman, described what generous philanthropists the brothers had been, noting that “the charity of the Kochs” had funded hospitals in New York and had eased the suffering of people with cancer; without the Kochs, he declared, “you can’t enjoy the arts in Manhattan.” At the gala, the “Morning Joe” hosts, who had secured exclusive interviews with the Kochs for the next morning’s newscast, did not exactly subject Charles Koch to a grilling. Scarborough’s penultimate question was to ask Koch how he had learned such “graciousness.” Fraser Seitel, the president of Emerald Partners, a public-relations firm, and the co-author of “Rethinking Reputation: How P.R. Trumps Marketing and Advertising in the New Media World,” told me that “third-party endorsements” of the type offered by Scarborough “are what the practice of public relations is based on.” Seitel continued, “You can try to tell people how good you are, but they won’t believe it until a third party acknowledges the goodness of your actions.” As the Kochs prepare to launch the most ambitious political effort of their lives, they appear to be undergoing the best image overhaul that their money can buy. Last fall, Charles sat down in his office with Kai Ryssdal, the host of public radio’s “Marketplace.” Koch said of his company, “Our attitude is to, in starting any initiative, any business, is to focus on how we can create value for others rather than how we maximize profit.” He chatted about how much he loved the movie “Reds” and noted that his house was “much bigger than I want.” At one point, Ryssdal observed, “You are everywhere lately, right?” He explained that the Kochs, after years of “making an art of not” being known “in the public arena,” had begun appearing on shows ranging from “CBS Sunday Morning” to “The Kelly File.” Koch Industries had even become a sponsor of “Marketplace.” “You guys are in Popular Mechanics, for crying out loud!” Ryssdal exclaimed. “Whoever is doing your P.R. is doing a great job.” “They\n",

He's also not been shy about standing up for what he believes in, even when corporate interests start pressuring him, such as his eloquent response to companies who urged him to support censorship via COICA.And, now, he's come out expressing serious concern about the recent domain name seizures done by Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) group. In a letter sent to Attorney General Eric Holder and ICE director John Morton (embedded below), Senator Wyden raises numerous questions, and it's clear that he thinks ICE has gonewhat is reasonable and legal. Many of the points in his letter seem to come directly from issues we've raised here on Techdirt -- including (specifically) the fact that all of the music used to seize the dajaz1.com domain were sent by music industry or artist representatives . He also seems quite concerned about who is driving these seizures, and if it's just companies trying to \"create competitive advantages in the marketplace.\"The letter highlights that we already have a process in the DMCA that lets copyright holders target and remove infringing content, and do so in a way \"without impinging on legitimate speech that the website may also facilitate.\" He also is clearly concerned about the lack of due process and the fact that these seizures do \"not appear to give targeted websites an opportunity to defend themselves before sanctions are imposed.\" He also notes that there's still a \"contentious legal debate about when a website may be held liable for infringing activities by its users\" -- a point that ICE continues to seem to think is settled law, when it is anything but. In fact, he notes: \"I worry that domain name seizures could function as a means for end-running the normal legal process in order to target websites that may prevail in full court.\" Finally, he points out that the whole thing is \"alarmingly unprecedented in breadth of its potential reach.\"From there, he lists out a series of questions that he wants Holder and Morton to answer:He basically seems to hit on all of the key points, so it'll be interesting to see how Holder and Morton reply, but given their existing responses in various speeches, it's not hard to predict that they'll sidestep most of these questions, and go with something along the lines of \"infringement bad! danger danger!\" Either way, kudos (again) to Senator Wyden for being one of the few politicians left who really does appear to care about free speech and due process.\n",

      "When Amazon released its new Fire HD 8 tablet last month, it promised that Alexa, the cloud-based voice service, would be added to Fire tablets in the coming weeks through a free over-the-air software update. That update is now available to owners of the 2016 Fire HD 8, as well as 2015's entry-level Fire and Fire HD 10 and 8.\n",

      "To activate Alexa, you press the on-screen home button, rather than simply saying her name, as you do with the Echo speakers. You can use voice commands to tell Alexa to play music, launch games, read audiobooks, deliver weather reports, turn on smart-home lights and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also link your Fire tablet to an Echo device. If you enable this feature in the settings menu, what you ask Alexa on the Echo will appear on the Fire tablet (the Fire appears to be off but is really in a special standby mode). For instance, if you ask the Echo for a weather report, Alexa will tell you the weather and that report will pop up on the Fire's screen. The Fire and Echo do have to be on the same wireless network for this feature to work.\n",

      "At launch Alexa's skill set on Fire tablets will be somewhat limited, but Amazon says it will be continually adding new \"skills,\" its version of apps.
