      " dispenser 10 or another piece of sheet material 12 contained therein. The dispenser 10 is provided with a dispensing mechanism 36 that allows for a piece of sheet material 12 to be dispensed from the dispenser 10 by a user and subsequently automatically advances a second piece of sheet material 12 for future removal so that a user does not have to touch the dispenser 10. The dispensing mechanism 36 may be configured in a number of ways in accordance with various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. For instance, the dispensing mechanism 36 may be configured so that the user will draw the sheet material 12 against a stationary cutting blade 22 in order to sever the piece of sheet material 12 and cause removal. Alternatively, the dispensing mechanism 36 may be configured so that the cutting blade 22 is moveable so as to automatically sever the sheet material 12 when pulled by a user.\n",
      "FIGS. 1 and 2 show the dispenser 10 with a dispensing mechanism 36 that is in an at rest or ready to dispense position. The dispenser 10 includes a frame 14 that houses the dispensing mechanism 36 and a roll 34 of sheet material 12. As used herein, the word “frame” is broad enough to cover any structure capable of holding or supporting at least a portion of the dispensing mechanism 36. For example, the frame 14 may include the housing of the dispenser 10. The frame 14 may completely surround the dispenser 10 or may only partially surround the dispenser 10.\n",
      "The roll 34 may be rotationally mounted on frame 14 in any manner commonly known to those having ordinary skill in the art. For instance, the roll 34 may be a cored roll that rotates on a mandrel disposed therethrough. Alternatively, the roll 34 may be a coreless roll in which a pair of studs may project from frame 14 and engage the roll 34 so that the roll 34 may rotate thereon. Additionally, in accordance with other exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the sheet material 12 need not be placed onto a roll 34, but instead the sheet material 12 is stacked in a folded stock or otherwise in the dispenser 10 to be dispensed therefrom.\n",
      "As shown in FIG. 1, the sheet material 12 is positioned in a nip between pressure roller 38 and drive roller 16. The pressure roller 38 may be spring biased so as to urge the sheet material 12 against drive roller 16 to hold sheet material 12 with a desired force. Pulling by a user of the sheet material 12 in turn will cause the drive roller 16 to rotate. Additionally, because the sheet material 12 is held against the drive roller 16, rotation of the drive roller 16 will cause the sheet material 12 to be advanced. Although described as being pulled by a user, the dispenser 10 may alternatively be configured as an automatic dispenser such that the drive roller 16 rotates automatically without the need for a user to pull on the sheet material 12. Devices to automatically rotate the drive roller 16 are commonly known to one having ordinary skill in the art.\n",
      "The frame 14 may include a pair of sheet guides 40 and 42 located beneath the pressure roller 38 and drive roller 16 and through which the sheet material 12 may be advanced. The sheet guides 40, 42 terminate at a discharge opening 44 of the dispenser 10 out of which the sheet material 12 may be positioned during the at rest or ready to dispense position of the dispensing mechanism 36. The sheet guide 40 defines a sheet guide opening 46, and the sheet guide 42 likewise defines a sheet guide opening 48. The sheet guide openings 46, 48 are in line with one another and may be angled in certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The purpose of the sheet guide openings 46, 48 is to allow for passage of the cutting blade 22 therethrough in order to cut the sheet material 12 when the dispenser 10 is configured for automatic cutting.\n",
      "Drive roller 16 is rigidly attached to a drive roller gear 50 that engages a float gear 24. Float gear 24 may be rotated through engagement with a first drive segment 52 of a segmented gear 18. It is to be understood, however, that the float gear 24 is not necessary in accordance with other exemplary embodiments. The first drive segment 52 is used primarily during the dispensing portion of the dispensing cycle while the second drive segment 54 of the segmented gear 18 is used primarily during the automatic advance portion of the dispensing cycle. Although shown as being arc-shaped, the segmented gear 18 may be variously configured in accordance with other exemplary embodiments of the present invention. For instance, segmented gear 18 may be disc-shaped, linear-shaped, or elliptical in accordance with various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The segmented gear 18 may be a full 360° gear or may be a linear gear such as a gear rack. In accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment, the segmented gear 18 may be a segment gear. The segmented gear 18 is a gear that includes at least two different drive segments. For instance, the segmented gear 18 shown in FIG. 1 includes\n",

Consider the expression z^n, where z = 1 + i and n is a positive integer. What is the polar form representation of z, and how can we use it to find z^n?</s><s>To find the polar form representation of z = 1 + i, we need to find its magnitude and argument. The magnitude of z, denoted by |z|, is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts. So, |z| = √(1^2 + 1^2) = √2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument of z, denoted by Arg(z), is the angle that z makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane. Since z lies in the first quadrant, we can find Arg(z) as the inverse tangent of the ratio of its imaginary part to its real part. Arg(z) = arctan(1/1) = π/4.\n",

      "\n",
      "This expression allows us to easily compute z^n for any positive integer n. For example, if n is a multiple of 4, then the argument nπ/4 is an integer multiple of π, and z^n will be purely real. If n is not a multiple of 4, then z^n will have both real and imaginary parts.\n",

The use of such unobtrusive devices yields detailed information on the amount of time that children spend in close-range proximity, allowing us to build a behavioral network representation where nodes represent children and a link between two children indicates that those children have spent time in face-to-face proximity (i.e., they have engaged in a “contact”). Each link can be weighted by the amount of time the corresponding individuals have spent in contact. This network conveys information that is complementary to the social ties assessed by means of surveys or questionnaires. The time-varying proximity network captures objective information about one specific behavior in space, automatically and without incurring in the recall biases of subjective reports on spatial proximity to other individuals. Surveys and questionnaires, on the other hand, capture a much broader class of ties, and can integrate the full wealth of information on the subjective view of individual relationships. Here we aim at building a fine-grained picture of gender-related behavioral homophily in children, and leverage the detailed information on face-to-face proximity patterns provided by sensors to produce a quantitative assessment of gender-dependent and age-dependence proximity behavior. A natural question we want to address is the extent to which these behavioral findings are congruent with the picture available in the literature, based on declared friendship relations and on the observed actual behavior of children.\n",

      "The article is structured as follows: a brief review of the literature on gender homophily and its evolution through the lifespan is presented first, together with some methodological perspectives on the use of electronic devices to measure behavioral aspects of human interactions. In the second part of the article we describe the dataset and the methodology used to collect it. Our results are presented in the third section. We report on statistical evidence of gender homophily in interaction patterns (i.e., proximity patterns in space), and we discuss the stability of neighborhoods from one day to the next. Finally, we use the high temporal resolution of the data to investigate how the correlation of homophily with age depends on the (behaviorally-defined) strength of the ties we consider. We obtain contrasted results that shed new light on the evolution of weak ties with age. We close with a short discussion and a call for further field research.\n",

      "\n",
      "Quantitative analyses on gender preferences date back to Moreno’s seminal work on sociometry, in which he introduces network terminology to describe relations between children from kindergarten through eighth grade. His study relies on direct observations and interviews with children, and makes inferences about the variables that affect friendships. He shows that although young children up to the second grade prefer same gender mates, some of them also name friends of the opposite gender. This gender mixing then almost disappears, very few children making any mixed friendship up to the sixth grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several studies have since confirmed and extended these results. A recent review shows in particular a consensus about the fact that gender homophily exists along the entire life span: it is already present in infants’ behaviors, increases up to a peak between 8 and 11 years, in agreement with Moreno’s study, and decreases afterwards, mainly because of the development of romantic relationships. It reaches a rather stable level among adults, although studies on this life period remain scarce.\n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, some differences of interaction styles between boys and girls have been brought to light. The first and widely reported difference is that boys tend to have a broader social network than girls, who instead tend to make deeper and stronger relationships. In particular, when children are asked to list their friends with no limitation on the number, boys name more friends than girls but most of the reciprocate nominations occur between girls. The evolution of interaction styles is moreover different for both genders. conclude from the direct observation of 193 children aged between 1 and 6 years that gender preferences increase earlier for girls than for boys, but later on they become stronger for boys than for girls. On the other hand, present a more moderate result. In a direct observation of 61 children between 39 and 74 months of age, they do not observe a significant correlation between age and the proportion of same sex playmates for the entire sample, but the correlation reaches a significant level when they consider boys only (this does not happen for girls). Indeed boys and girls behave differently, and differences in the amplitude of same gender preference have also been observed. asked 186 children about their positive, neutral or negative attitude toward all their classmates. While in the fourth grade girls are more positive towards boys than boys towards girls, the situation is reversed in the sixth grade. reach similar conclusions from questionnaires identifying friendships.\n",

      "During adolescence and the beginning of romantic relationships, girls show an earlier evolution in their attitude toward other sex mates than boys. report that girls declare to have frequent thoughts about the opposite sex one grade earlier than boys (but more moderately\n",
